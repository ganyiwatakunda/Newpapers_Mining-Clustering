EU's 'most embarrassing' day: How the AstraZeneca vaccine factory raid unravelled
","
Italian elite unit found millions of AstraZeneca doses thought to be meant for the UK - but their destination was the EU itself
",Bill Gardner,"
24 March 2021 • 7:55pm
","It was an extraordinary story – the European Commission   to find AstraZeneca's secret stockpile of vaccines reserved for Britain. During a surprise raid over the weekend, an elite unit of Italian military police acting on EU orders  . The discovery appeared to confirm the EU's long-held suspicion that AstraZeneca was giving the UK special treatment, secretly exporting doses to its home country while failing to deliver on contracts agreed with Brussels. Yet, as EU officials  , the allegation, briefed to the Continental press, simply wasn't true. In fact, most of the doses discovered in the Italian factory were destined for the EU itself, with the remainder headed for poorer countries across the world. One former Europe minister called it possibly the ""most embarrassing day in the EU's history"". Italy's La Stampa newspaper reported that Italian officers had  , where doses of the AstraZeneca vaccine are put into vials and labelled. The raid was carried out by the NAS, an elite unit of the Carabinieri which is part of the armed forces and usually investigates criminal syndicates suspected of counterfeiting food, wine and medicines. After inspecting the company's records, the officers   – roughly half AstraZeneca's delivery shortfall to the EU. EU sources briefed the newspaper that the shipment was thought to be secretly bound for the UK, despite the company having fallen far short of its promised deliveries to the bloc.  Italian authorities ordered the raid after Thierry Breton, the EU's commissioner for the internal market, raised suspicions during a visit to an AstraZeneca factory in Leiden, the Netherlands, earlier this month.  The commission issued the alert after Mr Breton suggested the numbers provided by AstraZeneca executives did not add up, suggesting a discrepancy between the reported overall supply and the number of doses reported by individual AstraZeneca factories. The raid came weeks after the Italian government   from the same factory under the EU's new export ban rules. The explosive news of a ""hidden"" bumper cache of jabs destined for the UK was quickly picked up by newspapers across the Continent. By mid-morning, however, the story began to unravel. British Government officials quickly insisted that supplies from the Catalent factory ""haven't been coming to the UK and we are not expecting anything from there"". Mario Gargiulo, the president of European biologics for Catalent, said the inspection by the Carabinieri had found ""everything in order"". Soon afterwards,  officials in Brussels admitted that the 29 million doses were in fact destined for AstraZeneca's plant in Belgium for onward distribution around the EU. An Italian government official said: ""On Saturday, the European Commission asked the prime minister to verify several consignments of vaccine in a production plant in Anagni. ""The Prime Minister informed the minister of health, Roberto Speranza, who arranged for the inspection to be carried out between Saturday and Sunday by the Carabinieri NAS. It emerged that the inspected batches were destined for Belgium. All outgoing batches were inspected."" AstraZeneca later said 16 million of the doses were ""waiting for quality control release to be dispatched to Europe"", while the other 13 million were to go to countries in the Covax vaccine-sharing scheme for developing countries. A spokesman said there were ""no exports currently planned other than to Covax countries"", adding that it was ""incorrect to describe this as a stockpile"". ""The process of manufacturing vaccines is very complex and time-consuming. In particular, vaccine doses must wait for quality control clearance after the filling of vials is completed,"" the spokesman said. Mr Breton later told the BBC that he had asked for the raid to ensure everything was on track and it had been ""helpful to understand what was happening in Italy"". But Bruno Maçães, Portugal's former Europe minister, called it possibly ""the most embarrassing day in EU history"". ""So Italian police raids a vaccine factory at suggestion of commission to find out these are vaccines for a global initiative aimed at providing equitable access to vaccines for some of the world's poorest regions? I think we're going to need an explanation of why Italian military police burst into a vaccine factory on false grounds,"" he added. However some EU officials were refusing to give up on Wednesday night, revealing that the commission had asked AstraZeneca for additional information about where the active ingredient in the vaccine vials found in Italy had been manufactured. Brussels sources indicated that the commission suspects that some of the drug substance sent to the Italian plant for packaging could have been produced in the much-scrutinised Halix plant in the Netherlands. So far the plant has not delivered vaccine doses to the EU because it does not have authorisation from European Medicines Agency. Member state officials have questioned why the approval process has not yet been completed, while the company has insisted it is ""on track"".  On Wednesday, AstraZeneca would only say that the vaccine doses had been brought from ""outside the EU"" to be packaged at the Italian plant. Other EU officials cast doubt over the doses reported by AstraZeneca to be destined for the Covax scheme, which the EU has exempted from any export bans. One told the Financial Times of suspicions that shipments ""go to some Covax countries to then be redirected to richer countries"". However, Valdis Dombrovskis, the EU's trade commissioner, was unequivocal and said the bloc would not impose any export restrictions on Covax, which plans to distribute two billion doses to poorer and middle income countries before the end of the year."

EU has a loaded gun on the negotiating table, but it won't pull the trigger
","
Exports of raw materials to the Pfizer factory in Belgium from Britain could be at risk if the EU blocks Covid vaccine supplies to the UK 
","James Crisp, ","
26 March 2021 • 12:36pm
","European Union leaders have left the gun of a vaccine export ban on the negotiating table with Britain but they don’t want to pull the trigger in case they shoot themselves in the collective foot.  The heads of state and government of the remaining 27 member states held a video summit on Thursday night to discuss stricter export controls on coronavirus vaccines.  , a slow vaccination rate and huge shortfalls of supplies of the AstraZeneca jab. Ursula von der Leyen, the European Commission president,  , which allows Brussels to stop exports to countries, like the UK, with higher vaccination rates than the EU and low exports to it. France, Spain and Italy wanted the biggest stick to wave at Britain possible, while Germany, Belgium, Ireland, and the Netherlands were worried about triggering a vaccine trade war.  Britain exports raw materials to the Pfizer factory in EU member Belgium, which could be at risk if the EU blocked vaccine supplies to the UK.  The European Council was too divided to agree to explicitly support the new rules in their summit conclusions.  This makes little difference legally because the rules had already entered into force through a commission implementing regulation. It could be quashed by EU member states over the next fortnight but it won’t be. It is politically significant. Mrs von der Leyen (below) will think twice without the support of her masters in the Council and they have made clear she is not to put supply chains at risk.  Mark Rutte of the Netherlands said he hoped the new rules would never be used.  The gun on the table may not have a full chamber but it is still loaded.  AstraZeneca, which Brussels accuses of breaking its supply contract with the EU, and by extension Britain is not off the hook.  Emmanuel Macron, Angela Merkel and Mrs von der Leyen were clear.  “Companies have to honour their contract to the European Union before they export to other regions in the world. And this is of course the case with AstraZeneca,” said Mrs von der Leyen, before adding the firm would have to “catch up” before it could export outside the EU. The commission has already threatened to block shipments of the Oxford University jab to the UK from AstraZeneca’s Halix plant in the Netherlands.  It wants Boris Johnson to drop the British first refusal on jabs manufactured in the two UK AstraZeneca plants so they can begin supplying the EU, which is foreseen in Brussels’ contract with the pharma giant.  Brussels says this is a matter of fairness because EU-based factories have exported so many vaccines to the UK. UK-EU negotiations are underway and will continue in the coming days.  The EU’s gun may not be quite as large as Mrs von der Leyen would have liked but it could still blow a hole in Britain’s vaccination rollout.  The commission has briefed member states that Britain is hugely dependent on EU supplies for the second phase of its vaccination programme.  Since December, Pfizer has sent the UK 20m doses. A further 1m came from AstraZeneca.  Just under 29m people have had their first jab in Britain. That suggests about 8m jabs in the UK were made in Britain or imported from suppliers outside the EU, which is by no means enough to fill a continental sized hole in imports.  The UK will struggle to vaccinate the rest of its population  , ensuring they are fully vaccinated, without EU supplies.  About 2.5m are fully vaccinated with a second dose, leaving about 26m people at risk of not being fully inoculated against coronavirus.  France’s foreign minister held up the EU’s gun this morning. He said the UK’s first dose policy, in which as many people were jabbed as quickly as possible meant there were no stockpiles reserved for second shots.  Jean-Yves Le Drian, France's foreign minister, said “Europe does not have to pay the price for this policy.” The UK-EU talks are the first since Britain left the transition period to not directly concern Brexit.  EU leaders have made clear their preference is for a deal rather than a trade war.  Unless the UK has a secret second shot stockpile stashed away somewhere, Boris Johnson may be forced to to find the least embarrassing way to give the EU what it wants.  That is likely to be an agreement to share supplies from the Halix factory and possibly, at a later date, from the two British-based factories as well.  That compromise will be far simpler to swallow once more and more people are vaccinated and more supplies come on stream in the coming months."

Exclusive: Britain to tell Brussels AstraZeneca jab would not exist without UK investment
","
Talks to break stand-off over Covid jabs manufactured in Netherlands and avert export ban will resume as early as Monday
","James Crisp, ","
27 March 2021 • 9:30pm
","Britain will this week tell the European Union that it must take into account the millions of pounds spent by British taxpayers on creating the AstraZeneca vaccine as   remains. Talks to break the stand-off over jabs  , will resume as early as Monday.   The European Commission has threatened to   because British-Swedish pharmaceutical company AstraZeneca has fallen far short of its contracted deliveries to the bloc.   Ursula von der Leyen, the commission president, last week   after she disclosed that factories in the EU had sent 21 million jabs to the UK since December but received none in return.   The UK-EU negotiations will focus on defining what ""reciprocity"" means, whether it would include finished vaccines or their ingredients and whether and how a deal would take into account investment in vaccine development.   British officials will argue that the EU has benefited from £84 million in funding for the manufacturing for the AstraZeneca jab, developed by scientists at the University of Oxford. Without this cash, the UK will say, there would be no vaccine at all.   The UK is pushing for Britain's per capita investment to be part of the calculations because it is a single country rather than the 27 member states of the bloc and so has proportionately invested more than some individual EU nations. According to the Government's recent spending review, it has paid more than £6 billion in total to develop and procure Covid vaccines.   The UK also exports raw materials to the Pfizer vaccine plant in Belgium. It plans significant increases in research and development, with almost £15 billion in 2021-22 including funding for clinical research to support delivery of new drugs, treatments and vaccines. Maros Sefcovic, the commission vice-president, told The Telegraph that investment in development would be one of the factors taken into consideration when evaluating reciprocity. The commission does not see reciprocity as being based on a simple dose-for-dose formula, not least because it is a major manufacturing hub for the jab. One diplomat said he was not surprised by the British demand, saying it ""seemed fair"". But the source warned that the EU would also want German investment in the development of the Pfizer jab to be taken into account.  ""And how do we subtract the European investment in Halix? And the advance purchase agreement of the EU for the production of AstraZeneca vaccines that never came about?"" the diplomat said."

A year of coronavirus lockdown: How Boris Johnson's hospitalisation sparked a 'jostling for position' in No10
","
Some of those closest to the centre of power recall the moment they feared they might lose the PM, and the Cabinet in-fighting that ensued
","Gordon Rayner, ","
18 March 2021 • 8:01pm
","Ever since his   last year, debate has raged about the extent to which the experience changed Boris Johnson's approach to tackling the pandemic. His most loyal aides have always insisted it did not change him at all – but some allies now privately concede that he emerged from his hospital stay a different man. ""That whole near-death experience made him look at this through a different lens,"" said one. ""After he came out of hospital... he started talking about how we could lose more people to Covid than we lost in the Second World War."" Irrespective of the effect his illness had on him, Mr Johnson's   was almost certainly the closest Britain has come to losing a Prime Minister in office since Margaret Thatcher in 1984. Now, for the first time, some of those who were closest to the centre of power while Mr Johnson's life hung in the balance have spoken about both the moment they feared they might lose him and the Cabinet in-fighting his absence prompted. The Prime Minister was taken into hospital  . While he fought for his life, another battle was going on at the heart of Government. ""It became a bit of a power struggle between different ministers,” said one well-placed source. ""We were trying to keep team spirit together, but Michael [Gove] and Dom Raab were taking chunks out of each other. It was just awful. ""There was a lot of talk of how Dom was trying to consolidate power, Michael was trying to muscle in on various committees and there was just lots of this noise going on. ""The PM was the final decision-maker, meaning that while he was in hospital it all went to Raab – but Gove didn't like that at all."" Another senior source said: ""There was an element of Gove and Hancock auditioning to be PM. But Raab did an excellent job. He earned everyone's respect by standing in, but not trying to be PM."" Others disagree. “We all know that Gove can be like that but during that period he categorically wasn’t,” said one, before adding. “Admittedly, I can’t say it was all peace and harmony...there was a bit of unease from the usual suspects and Cabinet colleagues had conversations with members who were being a little bit snippy.” A Government source said the claims were ""total nonsense"" and that the Cabinet ""really rallied together"", with no tension between the ""quad"" of senior ministers in charge in Mr Johnson's absence. It was on the evening of Thursday, March 26 that Mr Johnson  , telling the nation he had ""mild symptoms"" but was continuing to lead the Government while self-isolating. ""He was working from Rishi Sunak's office because it is below the flat in Number 11 where he and Carrie [Symonds] live,"" recalled one member of his team. ""The only people allowed to see him face to face were Martin Reynolds, his principal private secretary, and Lee Cain, his director of communications. ""There is a study and a private office with a door in between, and Martin and Lee would go into the other room and speak to him through the open door.""  Ms Symonds, Mr Johnson's fiancee, was   because she was heavily pregnant. But as his mandatory one-week self-isolation period neared its end, he was getting worse, not better. ""It was obvious he was getting more ill,"" said a source close to him. ""He was doing video messages for Twitter but he was taking five or six goes to get it right, where he is normally a one-take guy. Whenever people told him to take it easy, he kept saying: 'Strong like bull, strong like bull.' Except he wasn't. One time he said that and he beat his chest, which triggered an uncontrollable coughing fit."" Mr Johnson was having to manage without his most senior adviser, Dominic Cummings, who had   on March 27, the day after the Prime Minister had tested positive, and remained there until April 13 after suffering Covid-like symptoms. By the evening of Friday, April 3 staff were so concerned about Mr Johnson that a doctor was called, and on the Sunday that followed he called his key staff to tell them he was going into hospital. At the time Downing Street said it was a ""precautionary measure"" – but behind the scenes it was a different story. ""There was such a change in him,"" said one member of his team. ""He wasn't fully engaging in conversations and he was detached."" Officials checked with him that he wanted Mr Raab, the Foreign Secretary,   if he became incapacitated. He confirmed that Mr Raab was ""100 per cent"" his choice. Mr Johnson's blood oxygen levels had fallen dangerously low, and by the next day, Monday, April 6, ""the doctors were telling us it was looking pretty grisly"", one source said. Nominally at least, the Prime Minister remained in charge of the country, but at around 5.30pm that day, while Mr Raab was taking a turn to host the daily Downing Street press conference, the phone on the desk of Sir Mark Sedwill, the Cabinet Secretary, rang.  Sir Mark, who had been watching the press conference with his deputy Helen MacNamara, James Slack, the Prime Minister's official spokesman, and Mr Reynolds, answered the call, which was from St Thomas's Hospital. ""It was one of the two Nicks that rang,"" said a senior source [Dr Nick Price and Prof Nick Hart were in charge of Mr Johnson's care]. ""They said they were going to move him to intensive care. They said it was a ghastly situation because it was 50/50 whether he would need to go onto a ventilator, and if he did go onto a ventilator it was 50/50 whether he would survive."" In fact, the survival odds for Covid patients who were intubated were even lower than that at the time. Another source said: ""Undoubtedly that Monday evening was the lowest point. Going to bed that night was a scary time because you didn't know what you were going to wake up to the next day."" After the phone call from the hospital, ""things moved incredibly quickly"", one insider recalled. After Mr Raab finished his press conference he was called into Sir Mark's office and told he was going to have to take over. Mr Cain had finished his own period of self-isolation that afternoon and drove to Downing Street, where he became ""the Prime Minister's mouth in absentia"", as one official described it. The official said: ""There was a fear that the PM could die and everybody was determined to keep the ship moving on. A Cabinet call was arranged so everyone could be updated."" One person who was in Number 10 at the time said: ""It was surreal when we found out – it hit us like a freight train. There weren't many of us in Downing Street that day because a lot of people were working from home, so there wasn't much time to process it. We just had to get on with the job in hand."" Mr Raab was sent onto the airwaves to reassure the nation that the Prime Minister was ""in safe hands"". At St Thomas's, opposite Parliament on the other side of the Thames, Mr Johnson was  , as he later said himself. He recalled in an interview last May that ""the bloody indicators kept going in the wrong direction"" and that ""the doctors had all sorts of arrangements for what to do if things went badly wrong. They had a strategy to deal with a 'death of Stalin' type scenario. ""I was not in particularly brilliant shape, and I was aware there were contingency plans in place."" Back in Downing Street, staff avoided talking about what would happen if Mr Johnson died. ""They were pretty tough days,"" said one insider. ""We were trying to source PPE [personal protective equiopment] every morning. Meanwhile, the PM was getting a lot of oxygen and it was very scary for him. It wasn't until the Thursday that the messages from the hospital started to get more positive."" Along with Mr Raab, Mr Gove, the Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster, Matt Hancock, the Health Secretary, and Rishi Sunak, the Chancellor were the ministers at the forefront of running the country while Mr Johnson remained in hospital. One source said the balance between saving lives and saving the economy shifted when Mr Johnson was off sick. ""The debate started when the PM was in hospital,"" said the source. ""Sedwill was pro opening up. The two big political operators are the PM and the Chancellor and when the PM is away the officials gravitate towards the big beast who is left, who was the Chancellor."" Mr Raab was helped in Downing Street by Mr Reynolds, Mr Cain, Mr Slack and Isaac Levido, a pollster who had previously worked on the general election campaign and had been drafted in from the private sector to help out in the crisis. Mr Cain, a former tabloid journalist whose previous jobs famously included dressing in a chicken costume to taunt David Cameron during the 2010 election campaign, effectively stood in for Mr Johnson in key meetings by telling Mr Raab what the Prime Minister's thinking was on any given subject. ""Lee was cited on the papers that were being sent to Raab,"" said one source. ""He got every box that went to Raab, and in the same way that he would challenge things before they got to the PM, Lee did that for Raab. He was the intermediary."" Another source said: ""Lee was basically running the joint. Raab stepped in but Lee was very much running the Number 10 operation. He was in all of the key meetings with Raab, as the PM's right-hand man in the room, saying what the PM would have done. I can't recall anything on which he and Raab disagreed."" Mr Johnson was discharged from hospital on April 12, a week after he had been admitted, and  . Although no one knew it at the time, it was the same day as Mr Cummings was making   to ""test his eyesight"" before returning to London the next day. At Chequers, Mr Johnson was soon resuming work calls with, among others, the Queen and the then-US president, Donald Trump. Mr Trump  : ""He sounded incredible, he was ready to go – it's like the old Boris, tremendous energy, tremendous drive."" Mr Cummings, meanwhile, was becoming ever more evangelical about the benefits of lockdown. ""He had always been in favour of lockdown, and argued for doing it earlier than we did,"" said one former colleague. ""While he was off sick he read loads of stuff about pandemics and came back telling everyone that the countries that did best were the ones that locked down early and didn't unlock too soon. He said those countries lost fewer people and took a smaller hit to their economies."" Mr Johnson  , ""probably a week too early"", one aide now admits, and told the nation there were ""real signs now that we are passing through the peak"" of the virus. Two days later, his son Wilfred was born. So what effect did the Prime Minister’s darkest hour have on him?  “I do think it changed him,” said one friend of the Prime Minister. “He had been very hesitant about putting the country into lockdown, but after he came out of hospital it’s all been about protecting lives. “He started talking about how we could lose more people to Covid than we lost in the Second World War.” ""He was pretty determined before he went into hospital, and he was pretty determined when he came out,"" said one. ""The one obvious change was that he started talking a lot about how we were too fat as a country and  ."" Britain has already lost more people to the virus than died in the Blitz, but the war cost 450,000 British lives in total, or 0.94 per cent of the population, including 383,000 in the Armed Forces. To date, Covid has taken 125,000 lives, or around 0.2 per cent of the population. Those most loyal to Mr Johnson continue to hold to the official line that the events of last April made no difference to his policies. ""He was pretty determined before he went into hospital, and he was pretty determined when he came out,"" said one. ""The one obvious change was that he started talking a lot about how we were too fat as a country and  ."" Another Johnson loyalist said: “It didn’t change him at all. Both before and after he went into hospital he kept saying it was important the cure wasn’t worse than the virus.”"

Jean-Claude Juncker attacks Ursula von der Leyen for 'stupid' vaccines trade war with UK
","
Former European Commission president attacked EU vaccination strategy as penny-pinching and too cautious.
","James Crisp, ","
25 March 2021 • 1:09pm
","Jean-Claude Juncker has attacked Ursula von der Leyen, his successor as European Commission president, for starting  Mr Juncker said he was “not a fan” of Mrs von der Leyen’s threat of imposing an export ban on EU manufactured jabs to the UK and warned it would “create major reputational damage” for the bloc. “We used to be the world's free trade champion,"" he said as EU leaders meet for a summit to discuss the potential ban, ""We have to pull back from a vaccine war.” Mr Juncker also criticised the EU for being too slow in approving and buying vaccines, branding the bloc as “too cautious” and “budget conscious” in an interview with BBC’s HardTalk. The veteran politician led the commission from 2014 to 2019, which included the period after the Brexit referendum.  ""We have special relations with Britain, there's room for dialogue [...] nobody in Britain, nobody in Europe understands why we are witnessing such a stupid vaccine war,” Mr Juncker said.  “What the EU is asking for cannot be dealt with in a war atmosphere. We are not in war and we are not enemies - we are allies."" The former prime minister of Luxembourg added: ""I don't understand this [EU] temptation to fight against Britain, and the British temptation to fight against the EU. Let's discuss it amongst adult people. What is the image we're giving?'"" The EU summit, forced online because of the third wave of coronavirus sweeping Europe, is being held as new trade rules come into force which allow Brussels to target countries, like Britain, with higher vaccination rates than the EU.  The commission has already threatened to block the export of millions of AstraZeneca vaccines from the company's Halix plant in Leiden, the Netherlands. It wants the UK to forego its first refusal on supplies from AstraZeneca’s two British plants so they can supply the bloc. Divided EU leaders are expected to withhold explicit backing for a ban amid fears it could spark a vaccines trade war. But the pressure on Britain is expected to build because France, Germany and Italy all support Mrs von der Leyen’s plan to threaten bans targeted at AstraZeneca. "
politics,,,,,"We all know it, don’t we. Things go on at school that would be a police matter in the adult world. Schools have always turned a blind eye to bullying and intimidation.   It’s about time. My experience of a high-achieving boys’ private school in Birmingham the ‘80s was like Lord of the Flies meets The Krypton Factor. They were bright kids. And while they didn’t get away with murder, they certainly got away with assault. In one incident, four boys threw another out of a classroom window, slightly above ground level, leading to a horrible arm injury. It could have been his neck. In normal society, it would have meant a court case. But in school world, different rules apply – a few measly detentions and bags of street cred for the culprits. They probably still dine out on it. The victim? Who cares? It amuses me now, darkly, to look back at all those well-to-do parents thinking that they were giving their boys a great life model by sending them to that school, which topped all the exam tables. Some people look back on their schooldays as the best time of their life. I’m just relieved it’s over. Ahh, but that was the ‘80s, they’ll say. It’s all changed since then. Nurturing, safeguarding and all. Really? So how come a campaign asking children to report sexual assault and harassment has already collected nearly 5,000 testimonies including accounts from some as young as nine? These assaults didn’t happen in the ‘80s. They happened this month, on the streets we walk and drive along every day. Like all scandals, whether it be MPs’ expenses, Hollywood sexual predatory or celebrity child-abuse, the real scandal is that it takes so bloomin’ long to burst out. We know. But we stay silent, thereby complicit. How do these bullies get away with it? wonder countless generations of parents. They just do, because they always have. Boys will be boys. Toxic masculinity gets rewarded, because it’s never censured. The bully prospers, the victim deals with the scars. It was ever thus, so we never learn. “The teachers should stay out of it. Let the boys self-police”, announced a chap, oh so smugly, at an all-male, black-tie dinner I attended a few years ago. A couple of us who shook our heads incredulously. Let the boys self-police? Yes, if you want anarchy. Yes, if you want the class thugs to rule the roost. Yes, if you want boys to grow up – it now transpires – assuming they can get away with sexually assaulting fellow children. If a scandal is brewing, good. Perhaps, finally, we can have a national conversation about the importance of teaching positive masculinity – the sort on display by most decent, law-abiding boys and men up and down the country day in day out, but which is drowned out by the thuggish, misogynistic minority. Just like we teach maths and English. Meanwhile, we need a zero-tolerance approach to toxic masculinity. Most adults’ experience of current teen-school culture is limited to streets, buses and trains in early morning and late afternoon. Some kids are well-mannered, polite and considerate. Too many (yes, girls too) are rude at best, and vile at worst, to each other and adults. But we shrug it off. Best not to interfere. Safer that way. A national conversation, and a national taskforce, could at least start the process of changing this culture. It should present a vision of citizenship, and masculinity, that is positive, decent and caring, and challenge the accepted narrative that men will always be life’s baddies. Or, alternatively, we could take the advice of my dinner-party companion – and let the boys self-police."
politics,,,,,"Sometimes in politics it is convenient for a leader to retain an under-performing colleague in a senior position to act as a lightning conductor for criticism when things don’t go well. One thinks, for instance, of Boris Johnson’s decision to keep Gavin Williamson as Education Secretary during last summer’s debacle over exams - a fiasco that was caused at least in part by the PM’s own dithering and late decision-making. It worked a treat, with Williamson being compared to Frank Spencer of Some Mothers Do ‘Ave ’Em fame and zero headlines about bungling Boris. But when the whole team is floundering then the steely gaze of the electorate inevitably alights upon the captain - and that is what is happening to Keir Starmer right now. Starmer’s inner-circle briefing that he will shortly sack the beleaguered   hardly helps matters when shadow home secretary Nick Thomas-Symonds has just been brutally taken apart in the Commons - as he was last week by Home Secretary Priti Patel during one-sided exchanges about reforming the asylum system. Or when Labour deputy leader Angela Rayner has failed to generate any sense of wisdom or authority, but just spits out witless boilerplate abuse at her Tory foes like some superannuated bad girl at the back of the school bus. Everyone can see that Starmer himself is making misstep after misstep – appearing to side with the Duke and Duchess of Sussex against the Queen, flip-flopping over law and order legislation and looking around for a fence to sit on over matters such as the need to safeguard freedom of speech and inquiry against the Batley Islamists. When hard Left MPs in the Socialist Campaign group, such as  , no action to put her outside the Parliamentary Labour Party follows. When the reaction of Claudia Webbe, currently suspended from the PLP, to the Bristol riots is an analysis about police brutality being “the boot of a capitalist state” so crude that it would shame a sixth-form Leftist, there is no move to permanently expel her. When Clive Lewis MP whips up a left-wing outcry about Starmer trying to rehabilitate the Union Flag in Labour circles, Starmer relegates the flag rather than Mr Lewis. The cumulative impact of all this weakness on Starmer’s personal standing has been horrendous. YouGov’s monthly tracker of his net ratings tells the story: +16 in November, +5 in December, level pegging in January, -6 in February and -13 in March. Few things have gone south at such a relentless pace since Amundsen beat Scott in Antarctica. In such a context, inviting the hapless Ms Dodds to perform a Captain Oates impersonation is rather missing the point. It is the whole team that is failing. Over the last couple of months, Labour’s poll rating has plummeted from level-pegging with the Tories in the polls to an average of around eight points behind. The Tories are preferred by the electorate in almost every policy area – from the economy to law and order, from immigration to Europe. And crucially now on the battle against Covid too. Certainly, a lot of the change of fortunes is tied up with Britain’s brilliant vaccine roll-out and the EU’s disastrous one. But that a single issue should transform things to this extent also highlights Starmer’s failure to generate any sustainable sense of why voters should back his Labour Party. When everything seemed to be going wrong for the Government, the Labour leader baked himself a soufflé of support that has promptly collapsed. Labour now has a giant set of elections on the horizon that mark the start of parliamentary mid-term – a moment that ought to be accompanied by deepening unpopularity for the governing party and at least the feeling that the main party of opposition is on a roll. Yet, aside from a likely landslide victory for Sadiq Khan in the London mayoral race, expectations for Labour’s showing are dire. That Khan, an identikit identity politics merchant, is set to be the Labour poster boy this Spring hardly helps a party that is looking to rebuild support in socially conservative “Red Wall” towns lost to the Tories in December 2019. Should Labour fail to win the parliamentary by-election in Hartlepool – somewhere it defended successfully even in the midst of that Tory landslide – then the idea that Starmer has made any impact at all in a debut year dominated by the Government making highly visible mistakes as it battled the worst peacetime crisis in living memory will be kaput. Even were Labour to limp home with a reduced majority the same impression of zero progress would be conveyed to many.   
 
Some Labour thinkers who regard themselves as pessimism-tinged realists suppose that Starmer is on course to be a 21st century version of Neil Kinnock – a man who makes Labour electable again but then hands on to a successor to complete the mission. In making such a diagnosis they suppose that they are downplaying expectations. The truth is that currently he is looking nowhere near as good as that."

Special report: Sturgeon clings to tarnished crown after inquiries ‘lift lid on the sewer’ of SNP politics
","
First Minister has been cleared twice but, with Alex Salmond chief among threats, whether her leadership survives may decide future of Union
","Gordon Rayner, ","
26 March 2021 • 6:11pm
","“It’s very clear that Nicola Sturgeon is damaged goods and her days are numbered. She is by no means off the hook.” The sort of verdict you might expect from a flag-waving Unionist at the end of a tempestuous week for the Scottish National Party. Except that those words were spoken by a former deputy leader of the SNP itself, even before Alex Salmond’s The jubilation among the First Minister’s supporters after she survived two inquiries into her role in the Alex Salmond affair lasted all of three days before Mr Salmond pulled back the tarpaulin on his ultimate vengeance weapon, the Alba Party, which threatens to blow up the SNP’s chances of a Holyrood majority in the May 6 elections. If the SNP – currently a minority government – achieves an overall majority, the party’s plans to force a second independence referendum will be rapidly accelerated. There is a growing belief within the SNP, however, that the party will fall short of the mark, and that if “IndyRef2” does happen, it might not be with Ms Sturgeon at the helm. The SNP’s poll rating peaked at 58 per cent last autumn, and stayed above 50 per cent for the whole of last year, putting the party on course for a majority,   according to a recent Opinium poll, suggesting the controversy has taken its toll. The twin inquiries into the SNP’s handling of sexual misconduct allegations made against former leader Mr Salmond have exposed to public view the toxic civil war between the Sturgeonites and the Salmondites, like a manhole cover being lifted off a sewer. Mr Salmond now intends to go another round with Ms Sturgeon in a fresh court case that could reveal damaging details suppressed in the inquiries. Then, at 2pm on Friday, came that Mr Salmond is to lead a new party into the elections. Its aim, he claims, is to achieve a “supermajority” for independence in the Scottish parliament, but its effect is more likely to be splitting the vote between the SNP and Alba (the Scottish Gaelic name for Scotland). Mr Salmond said on Friday that Alba was “planting our saltire on a hill” and that “in the next few weeks we shall see how many will rally to our standard”. In truth, he is parking his tanks on Ms Sturgeon’s lawn, driving a wedge into the split that already exists in the SNP, and calling on its members, MPs and MSPs to defect to his side. If he is elected to Holyrood, it will be the start of an all-out war between Ms Sturgeon and Mr Salmond for the leadership, and the future, of Scotland.   Jim Sillars, the former deputy leader of the SNP, said: “I was a long-term critic of Alex Salmond when he led the SNP, and he of me. I take back not a word, and I expect him to be the same. “But Brexit, the pandemic, the failures of the SNP, the embarrassing stark lack of quality in its ranks in Holyrood, means we are in a new situation when old grievances need to be set aside. I welcome his return to frontline politics.” He added: “People have seen a face of the Scottish government that is unacceptable. People are not stupid. They know the government has misbehaved and engaged in a gross misuse of power. “This government is politically corrupt and the tentacles of political corruption have spread to institutions in civic society.” One serving SNP MP admitted: “Nicola’s brand has been tarnished. I think this will have an impact at the polls because people have seen the in-fighting and the rage.” For those who have not followed the labyrinthine progress of the Salmond affair, the basic facts are these: in 2018, details were leaked to a Scottish newspaper of sexual misconduct allegations against Mr Salmond, dating to 2013 when he was first minister. Mr Salmond denied the claims, accused the Scottish government of an abuse of process in its handling of the claims, and won a 2019 court case against the government, which had to pay him more than £500,000 for legal expenses. Weeks after winning the court case, Mr Salmond was charged by police with sexually assaulting nine women while he was first minister. He was cleared of 12 charges at a trial last year, the jury finding the 13th charge “not proven”. Mr Salmond accused members of the Sturgeon administration of by encouraging women to make complaints against him, which the SNP has always denied. He claimed Ms Sturgeon had known about the allegations for longer than she had admitted, and had lied to the Scottish Parliament about when she found out, a resignation matter if true. An independent inquiry by Irish barrister James Hamilton  though a committee of MSPs found  At the heart of the problem with Scottish politics is what Mr Sillars terms a “cult of personality” that began with Mr Salmond and was continued by Ms Sturgeon when she took over as SNP leader following defeat for the independence campaign in 2014’s “once in a generation” referendum. The SNP has not had a leadership election since 2004, such has been the dominance of Salmond and his former protege, but as one long-standing SNP member complained: “Any political party should be much bigger than one figure, because people always turn out to have feet of clay.” A cult is the opposite of a democracy, and the charge sheet of undemocratic behaviour by the SNP is growing. The party’s opponents cite the role of the Crown Office, the equivalent of England’s Crown Prosecution Service, which was able to  – over the two inquiries. In most democracies, the principle of the separation of powers means that prosecutors and politicians operate independently, as with England’s director of public prosecutions. But in Scotland, the Crown Office is headed by the Lord Advocate, who is also a member of the Cabinet, meaning the person who ultimately decides who does and does not face prosecution is a politician loyal to Ms Sturgeon (currently James Wolffe). As the former Brexit secretary “that leaves him conflicted and compromised, with his department’s independence undermined”. When the two inquiries’ reports were published this week, large sections were redacted on the orders of the Crown Office; Mr Hamilton himself complained that the redactions meant his own report “presents an incomplete and even at times misleading version of what happened”. Evidence given by Mr Salmond was redacted to protect the identities of complainants, according to the Crown Office, but Mr Davis, and others, have claimed the redactions did not identify the women and were designed only to protect Ms Sturgeon. Meanwhile, the somewhat toothless committee of MSPs which carried out the parliamentary inquiry complained that key evidence it requested from the Scottish government arrived with widespread redactions, with some documents “almost completely blank” and others with “pages and pages of fully redacted text”. The committee complained: “We did not know the basis on which redactions were being made.” Mr Salmond, ominously for Ms Sturgeon, has a plan to get that evidence out in the open. On Wednesday, he announced his intention to sue the Scottish government’s Permanent Secretary, Leslie Evans, whom he blamed for “catastrophic failures in this matter”. He pointed out that the courts would have “all the proper powers of recovery of documents” which the parliamentary committee lacked, and friends of Mr Salmond have confirmed that he believes those documents will implicate Ms Sturgeon’s office in what he sees as a conspiracy against him. He has also made a complaint to Police Scotland about the leaking of a story about the complaints against him in 2018, which could further embarrass the SNP if it proves to have come from someone close to Ms Sturgeon. “This could go on for a long time and could yet bring Nicola down,” admitted a senior SNP source. Amid the fevered anticipation of the inquiry reports, another potential time-bomb for Ms Sturgeon went largely unnoticed last weekend. Three members of the SNP’s Finance and Audit Committee resigned, reportedly because they had been denied full access to the party’s books by SNP chief executive Peter Murrell, also known as the husband of Nicola Sturgeon. One of the departees, Cynthia Guthrie, was announced yesterday as an Alba Party candidate. The SNP has not reported or even confirmed the resignations, let alone the reasons for them, and party sources have told The Telegraph they are “having a hard time” getting to the bottom of the matter. Questions about management of the SNP’s finances are not new: the party raised £600,000 for a second referendum campaign which it claimed was “ringfenced”, but only had £97,000 in the bank in its most recent accounts, and members now report being asked for more donations for a referendum “fighting fund”. A spokesman for the SNP said three people had resigned from its finance and audit committee following concerns about leaks to the media, and denied Mr Murrell had failed to provide access to the accounts.  It said the £600,000 raised for a referendum “is allocated to our 2021 budget and will be spent in this financial year”. Despite the whiff of scandal that has hung over Auld Reekie for the past three years, relatively few public figures have dared to speak out against the SNP, such is   its power and electoral dominance have engendered north of the border. Jack Perry CBE, the former chief executive of Scottish Enterprise, the national innovation and investment agency, has witnessed it at first hand. “The SNP party machine is good at intimidation,” he said. “It’s implicit that if you oppose them or offend them, you won’t get much business in the future. I have been at business events where every single firm is anti-independence but when an SNP minister turns up not a single person challenges them because they are afraid to.” Glasgow-based Barrhead Travel from nationalists when it backed the No campaign in the independence referendum.  when it branded its teacakes “British” rather than Scottish south of the border. Other businesses have learnt to keep quiet for fear of a fight with the so-called “cybernats” who launch attacks via social media. Earlier this week, it emerged that former Manchester United football manager Sir Alex Ferguson, not normally regarded as a shrinking violet,  in the 2014 referendum because “the people putting their heads above the parapet were getting shot at”, according to Alistair Campbell’s latest diaries. Sir Alex feared “dog’s abuse” for standing up for the Union, in which he is a passionate believer. Scots rely far more heavily on their government for employment than the English: the public sector accounts for 21.8 per cent of jobs in Scotland, compared with 16.4 per cent in England, meaning “a lot of private companies are reliant on public sector contracts”, Mr Perry said. He added that quangos which were once headed by independent-minded patrons ready to challenge the government and improve policy were now all too often populated with unquestioning SNP supporters. Even the education of Scotland’s children is up for grabs when it comes to promoting the nationalist cause, critics say. In December, Education Scotland finally withdrew a timeline of Scottish history after Sir Tom Devine, the country’s leading historian, Among its false claims was that Sir Winston Churchill “dispatched English troops and tanks” to stamp out a major protest by striking workers in Glasgow in 1919 while locking up Scottish soldiers in barracks. Other errors included a suggestion that Flower of Scotland – written in the 1960s – dated as far back as the Battle of Bannockburn in 1314. Academics had raised the alarm almost two years before the timeline – “clearly designed in the cause of Scottish independence”, according to one history professor – was eventually removed. Nor is the supposedly politically neutral civil service immune from the SNP’s iron grip. A taxpayer-funded Scottish Government video released at new year described the Brexit trade deal as “a bad deal for Scotland” that would cause “greater risk to national security”, prompting accusations that the civil service was While the SNP is ruthless in targeting its opponents, it reserves its most sinister threats for those within its ranks.  Joanna Cherry, the SNP MP for Edinburgh South West, was  last month following a row over transgender law reform (Ms Cherry QC believes the SNP is going too far in simplifying the legal process for changing gender). She later revealed she had been subjected to “an 18-month campaign of abuse” culminating with “a threat of corrective rape from a party member”. Other SNP members had bombarded her with abuse, calling her a **** , while friends said she had been subjected to “bullying, lies and smears” from her colleagues. “It has become an anti-free speech party,” said one Sturgeon critic within the SNP. “Anyone who dares to depart from the party line and suggest new ideas is pretty much crushed.” Fraser Nelson, the editor of The Spectator and a proud Scot, has also faced apparent attempts to intimidate him after his magazine went to court to fight for the right to publish Alex Salmond’s evidence in full (opposed, inevitably, by the Crown Office). Trisha Marwick, the former presiding officer (Speaker) of the Scottish Parliament tweeted: “We see you Fraser,” with sinister overtones of “we know where you live”. Douglas Ross, leader of the Scottish Conservatives, said: ""Sturgeon is clearly suffering from hubris. She is not out of the woods. Neither she nor any other person has been held to account for this litany of scandals. “Most people are rightly repulsed by this unedifying feud and her scorched earth approach has undermined public faith in Scotland's parliament.” As a senior member of the SNP told The Telegraph: “If I didn’t depend on the SNP for my employment, I would have cut up my membership card by now.” A recent survey found that only 8 per cent of Scots rank independence as one of the top three most important issues ahead of the May elections, with Covid recovery, jobs and healthcare their more pressing concerns. For Ms Sturgeon, independence is a useful megaphone to drown out any discussion of her failures, which are numerous. Under her watch educational attainment is down; drug-related deaths have more than doubled (to three and a half times the rate for England, and by far the worst in Europe); life expectancy has decreased in some areas, and even before Covid, Scotland was running a   than the rest of the UK. The SNP also has no answers to key questions around what an independent Scotland would look like –   whether it would have its own armed forces, how it would pay its way without its current subsidies from Westminster – with one SNP MP blaming “intellectual laziness” within the party for its failure to come up with a plan. Despite such failings, after 14 years in power, the SNP seems certain to be the largest party yet again on May 6, either with a majority (for which just four more seats out of 129 are needed) or as a minority government backed by the pro-independence Greens. It will leave the SNP defying political gravity by retaining power for at least 18 years by the time of the 2025 election, a record matched only by the Conservatives during the Thatcher and Major era. What then? Ironically, the issue of independence is likely to present a threat to Ms Sturgeon from within her party. She will face significant pressure from the radical wing of her party to call an indicative referendum straight away (which would not be legally binding without consent from Westminster), capitalising on Boris Johnson’s unpopularity in Scotland. Ms Sturgeon, however, is by nature more cautious, preferring to build support for independence until the polls suggest a virtually guaranteed win, which at the moment they do not. Were Ms Sturgeon to succumb to activists’ wishes for a quick referendum but fail to win it, she would lose not only the leadership, but very possibly her hopes of breaking up the Union for decades to come. Whether she even gets to make that choice could yet be in the hands of Mr Salmond."

Owen Paterson on the agony of his wife's suicide: 'It's horrifying to think she was suffering so badly without us knowing'
","
The MP for North Shropshire has spoken candidly about Rose’s suicide in the hope that it will help others
","Camilla Tominey, ","
29 January 2021 • 9:52pm
","When the police told Owen Paterson his wife Rose had been found   of their Shropshire home, his last desperate hope was that she had been murdered. “In some ways that would have been easier to process than suicide,” admits the former cabinet minister. “That is how terrible suicide is for those left behind. It is just so hard to comprehend how someone could be so desperate that they feel this is the only way out. “Here we are, seven months on, and it’s absolutely horrifying to think that Rose was also suffering so badly without us knowing. “I miss her so much, and so often find myself on the point of calling her, as if she is still with us. The fact that we’ll never speak again is nothing short of devastating.""  The pain is etched on the veteran politician’s face as he describes how he can no longer listen to the Mozart that was played at their 1980 wedding, or Cockney Rebel, the Steve Harley song that provided the soundtrack to their days together at the University of Cambridge in the Seventies. But it is seeing their 21-month-old granddaughter, Sylvie, that brings home the  , which affects 16 families in Britain every single day.  “Rose will never see her first daubed paintings, she will never go to her first school play. It's just so desperately sad.” Owen, who has been the MP for North Shropshire for 23 years, has decided to speak candidly about Rose’s death for the first time to a national newspaper in the hope that it will help others. “If I can help stop just one family from experiencing the utter agony we have gone through, then I will have done something worthwhile,” insists the former environment and Northern Ireland secretary. With his sons Felix, 34, Ned, 32 and daughter Evie, 28, Owen is poised to launch The Rose Paterson Trust, a charity dedicated to raising money for  , suicide bereavement and projects promoting mental and physical health. The Trust has recently been awarded charitable status and will be officially unveiled on the day of the Grand National on April 10, in honour of Rose, who was chairman of Aintree Racecourse.  The Grand National has always been a big day for the family, but this year they hope that it will enable them to do some real good in Rose’s memory. “Rose was such a kind and caring person by nature,” said Owen. “We know she would want us to help others. She did so much for charity herself. We just want to make her proud.” Owen had no idea that his beloved wife of 40 years was feeling suicidal in the days before she was found dead in the early hours of June 24, his 64th birthday. When she did not answer his telephone calls from the House of Commons on the morning she went missing, he did not think anything of it.  As well as her work with Aintree and as a Steward of the Jockey Club, Rose would often be out and about, too busy to respond to messages.  But when calls to their home near Ellesmere continued to go unanswered at 6pm that evening, Owen began to worry. “I wasn’t entirely surprised she hadn’t got back to me because she would often be out in the garden or at Aintree. “But she’d nearly always be back by the evening because she was very punctilious about keeping on top of emails.” After another couple of hours went by with no word from Rose, Ned, who was the last person to see her the previous evening, watching a TV documentary on Persian history, raised the alarm. By 8.15pm, Owen had called the police. “That’s when the whole nightmare began,” he recalls. As more and more neighbours joined the effort to find Rose, he jumped in the car with Felix, who lives in south London, and immediately drove to Shropshire. Throughout the 200-mile journey north, they were in constant communication with Ned.  “We went through everything over and over: heart attack, stroke, some respiratory collapse. Had she slipped and banged her head on a rock? Had a branch fallen on her head? We had all these crazy ideas. We never, ever thought of suicide.” Arriving home as a helicopter circled overhead, the lead police officer on the case walked straight up to Owen and asked him a question he will never forget. “Looking back, he knew exactly what he was looking for,” Owen concedes. “He said, ‘Mr Paterson, does your wife suffer from depression?’ Irritated, Owen dismissed the idea and stressed the urgency of finding his wife alive.  “I said: ‘Please, I'm really worried, it’s been a really hot June day, she'll be out there dehydrating’.” By then it was half past midnight. “We could see them with their torches working the wood very methodically. We did hear some shouting and then the shouting stopped.  “At around 4am, the Police called us into the kitchen and said they’d found a female body and the appearance conformed to Rose Paterson.” At that point Owen demanded that Rose’s body not be taken down until he had had the chance to see her for a final time. “I hoped it would be anything but suicide. But when I went down there, it was quite obvious that she’d killed herself.” He then had to break the horrendous news to the couple’s daughter, Evie, 28, who was on holiday in France, awaiting Rose’s arrival the following day. West Mercia police later informed the family that Rose had been searching suicide websites a fortnight before, at seven in the morning.  “People say, ‘Oh you mustn’t beat yourself up' but of course I beat myself up every single day,” said Owen. The timing, on his birthday, only added to the family’s sense of bewilderment. Rose had been planning to travel to London that day to see an aunt who had just come out of lockdown, before organising a birthday dinner for Owen and then travelling out to France. She was also chairing a virtual meeting at Aintree.     “All the papers are still on her desk,” said Owen. “I just can’t bear to move them. “What is utterly tragic is that Rose's career was really blossoming. She’d done wonderful work at Aintree on animal welfare and making it more inclusive to women and families. She was doing some terrific stuff for Park Palace Ponies, an inner-city riding school in Toxteth."" Although the inquest into Rose’s death in  , she had not been on any medication for several years. “The coroner answers the who, what, when, where, how questions but never the why,"" said Owen. ""We will never definitively know why.” The couple had been under some pressure since the last general election, following a number of press reports about Owen’s external consultancy work. There had also been criticism of the racing industry for allowing the  . Owen believes them both catching Covid-19 at the beginning of the first lockdown may have had an impact on Rose’s mental health. “Rose didn’t like being ill and with the family at home she rallied round and seemed to get better far sooner than I did. “But ongoing research into the virus shows that, while it has a bigger, physical effect on men, women are disproportionately affected neurologically. Some it seems have had mini strokes and others behavioural changes.” He also blames the suicide websites she secretly visited for “drawing her in”. “Many of these suicides are on impulse. The narrative these sites use is so beguiling and it's written in such calm language.  “Yet these sites never talk about the damage on those you leave behind.” Citing evidence which suggests every suicide affects 135 people, he adds: “I feel quite strongly that if she had known the utter catastrophe she's brought on herself and many people – not just immediate family – she wouldn’t have done it. “Every suicide is unnecessary. Every suicide is avoidable. “The utter tragedy of this is Rose – a wonderful woman who everyone loved so very much – has lost her life and our lives have been changed forever.” Owen’s first Christmas in more than four decades without Rose passed in a “blur” with him spending two freezing cold hours at her grave side at the family home.  “I just wanted to be next to her,"" he said. ""I played Schubert and Mahler and stuff that she loved.” The daughter of the 4th Viscount Ridley, who was brought up on the Blagdon Estate in Northumberland, Rose had a fierce intellect and an unparalleled knowledge of horses.  “I miss her brain,"" said Owen. ""I had a second brain. She was incredibly well read and she kept me up to date on stuff. I can already feel all my racing knowledge slipping away because she's not here.” Admitting he had no previous experience of suicide, he is now trying to educate himself to help others. “If one person reading this, just one person, thinks twice about taking their own life, then it will be worth it. “Society has this image of someone who is caricatured as depressed, whose life has gone badly wrong. Rose was anxious but I wouldn't say she was depressed. “So if anyone reading this knows someone who is anxious, then please just talk to them. You may well be saving their life."""
politics,,,,,"One of our respected universities released a guide to how to play Russian roulette to entertain others for money in December.   Among its stated aims it said the university policy was to “ensure that any students who play Russian roulette are positively supported, with their personal wellbeing and safety being considered as a priority” and to “ensure that University staff are aware of their responsibilities to support students through a non-judgemental approach”. Its policy statement read: “The University is firmly committed to sustaining an inclusive learning, working and research environment for all students, this includes students earning money or other commodities through Russian roulette. We recognise the social stigma associated with Russian roulette and support students who earn a living through Russian roulette. Students may increasingly turn to Russian roulette to fund their studies. ‘Outing’ individuals about their status without their consent puts students at risk of harm.”  Actually, it doesn’t say that. It’s not supporting students who are struggling so badly financially that they will do anything - literally as crazy as the idea of playing Russian roulette for the entertainment of others would be - to support themselves.  No, this university, and multiple other unis all over the country, are all talking about sex work - not Russian roulette - supporting students who turn to prostitution when they cannot make ends meet, by publishing   which aim to offer advice and support to the vendor. Which would be all well and good if the whole idea weren't so desperately sad and depressing. By setting out not to challenge the assertion that it’s a fundamentally bad idea to go into sex work to get your degree, these organisations really aren’t helping at all.  Let’s be clear: women (and, obviously, some men) are not being offered no-strings financial support to help them sustain their degrees. Instead, they are being shown a picture of normalised prostitution. Many might think that an academic institution - which is home to those women and men, including from the trans community, who are so vulnerable and frightened of losing their places at university, perhaps even their homes, due to lack of money that prostitution becomes an option - should be stepping in to stop it. That these places should be the actual role models for showing how education is the exit route from poverty, not selling yourself. Sure, there’s a school of thought which claims sex work to be an empowering and even fun way to earn that extra dosh.  Although if that were so, we’d see far fewer vulnerable people in the business, their places jostled away by glamorous and robust yuppies, eager to make some extra money for next winter’s trip to Barbados. As if. Anyway appearances are not the crux of the matter - safety is. Anyone who is involved in prostitution or sex work deserves to do so without fear of physical or mental abuse.  But there is no evidence an online toolkit can achieve this. It may give the illusion that there are ways to sell sex without fear or stigma, but there’s no proof anyone or anything can do this.   Research does show that there is a   but that one of the greatest factors in preventing this comes down not to lack of ideas but lack of data and official interest. Violence against women (and men, and those who are trans) in the sex trade is constantly overlooked when discussions take place about violence as a whole. The funding isn’t there. The taxpayers are not crying out for it.   Far more energy seems spent on redefining it as an employment choice than admitting that sex work comes with unimaginably high risks. What is documented is that violence connected to sex work can cause poor health overall, physical and sexual injury,  , anxiety, and post-traumatic stress disorder, unwanted pregnancy, abortion, and increased risk for HIV and other sexually transmitted infections (STIs).  How on earth is a policy statement going to protect a student from any of that? It really doesn't matter whether you think prostitution is a good or bad thing as a societal entity. But we can all surely agree it is one of the most dangerous ways imaginable to make up a shortfall in a student grant.    Universities offering tips to stay safe - have a mirror in your room so you can see what the client is up to at all times - is pitiful stuff.  Posting a copy of the toolkit’s mission statement on your wall isn’t going to be much cop against a violent predatory man with a history of sexual abuse and a prison record.  Policies written with the best intentions cannot possibly do the one thing any putative prostitute would need from them to remain 100 per cent safe. And that is to create an algorithm that identifies which sex-buyer is safe and which one is not.    Until then, all the online tool-kits in the world won’t make selling your body safe. But they may make you  safer. It’s in that gap where the problem lies. Were universities really interested in the safety of their students they would reduce fees, offer financial advice, save paid work on campus for those young people who need it most.  They would offer cash grants not gimmicky tips. If “personal wellbeing and safety” were considered as “a priority”, no university would sanction a guide to prostitution, any more than they would to running up and down motorways or playing Russian roulette. Because it is inherently unsafe.  The naivety is not in thinking prostitution doesn’t go on and will always be with us. It is in encouraging a new generation of young people to think it is no different in risk to other forms of remuneration."
politics,,,,,"Infections are running at 40,000 a day in France. In Poland, the rate is hitting 35,000 a day, while Italy and Germany are all regularly racking up more than 20,000 new cases of Covid-19 on a daily basis. In the UK, thanks to a mixture of lockdown, and a rapid roll-out of vaccines, the virus is coming back under control, with deaths, hospitalisations and infections all  . Across most of continental Europe, by contrast, it is spiralling out of control. Even worse, new variants, such as the South Africa and Brazilian strains, are rising rapidly.  That is a tragedy for the countries involved of course. But it is a big problem for the UK as well. We might be an island, but we do huge amounts of trade with the rest of Europe, and with completely open borders, there is a real risk the virus will seep back into Britain. That is not a risk worth taking. A decision on   may come as early as tomorrow, and other major trading partners may follow soon afterwards. In truth, the economy needs to brace itself for the closure of the border, with a dramatic re-routing of supply chains, and with goods sourced from elsewhere. It won’t be easy – but with some planning it should be possible.  Europe is witnessing a third wave of Covid-19. France, Italy, Germany, Poland, the Netherlands, the Czech Republic and Hungary have all seen a steep rise in cases. France has gone back into regional lockdown. Germany is attempting an Easter ‘firebreak’, even if Chancellor Angela Merkel has had to reverse some of those measures after protests from the regional states, while Poland is closing non-essential shops and hotels for three weeks. There will be plenty of people to blame for that. Political leaders were far too relaxed about the spread of the more infectious Kent variant, as well as mutations from elsewhere. There is so much movement of people and goods between Poland and the UK, between Portugal and Brazil, and between South Africa and everywhere, that it was always going to be hard to keep those twists on the virus out. Far worse has been the EU’s catastrophic mismanagement of the vaccination campaign: it ordered the wrong vaccines, spent too little money, dithered over authorisations, and then spread what at times looked like an orchestrated campaign to undermine confidence in the only one that was likely to be available in sufficient quantities – the Oxford-AstraZeneca – to control the spread of Covid-19. The virus should have hit a vaccinated wall and been stopped in its tracks. Instead, new variants were allowed to spread unchecked among populations with no immunity. It has been a disaster, and one that could have been prevented.  True, vaccination rates are speeding up. France has finally started hitting more than 300,000 jabs a day, and Germany more than 250,000 – heck, they might even cut down the ten forms you have to complete before the syringe goes to work – daily. Judging by the miraculous data from Israel, the UK, and now the United States, the virus should start to come under control. There are two problems, however. It will take at least six weeks for the numbers to start to fall. More worryingly, we don’t know exactly how effective the existing shots are against the mutations, or indeed what new variants will emerge as the virus spreads unchecked across the continent. Europe should be able to vaccinate its way out of this mess. But we don’t know that for sure.  The UK is already examining putting France  of countries with strict border controls. The Netherlands, Germany, Italy and Poland may not be far behind. Sure, there are powerful reasons to hesitate before taking that step. Tourism will take a terrible hit, and more importantly it will make it very hard to keep goods flowing into and out of the country. Even so, the economy needs to brace itself, and businesses need to start preparing. Like how? Here are three places to start.  First, companies need to start building better buffers to their supply chains so they can cope with disruption. There have already been a couple of dry runs, first with our departure from the European Union, and then after the restrictions the French government imposed in December to keep out the Kent variant. If “just-in-time” logistics were not dead already, this should finish it off. In reality, warehousing and stockpiles need to make a major comeback, so that border closures are turned into a minor hiccup instead of a full-blown crisis. Next, companies need to diversify supply chains away from continental Europe. Right now, if you can buy it somewhere else, you probably should. We import vast amounts of food from continental Europe, but Morocco, Israel, Australia, New Zealand, Canada and the United States are all alternatives, and while the shipping costs might add a little to the bill, there will be far less risk of disruption over the next few months. The UK has been reducing its trade with the rest of Europe for years, but this should put that process into hyper-drive. Finally, border guards need to be put in place and testing facilities for truck drivers, with plenty of quarantine facilities as well. It is the roll-on/roll-off lorries, mainly coming into Dover, that pose the real risk. Interestingly, that traffic was in steady decline already (the Ro-Ro tonnage with France has fallen by 14pc since 2016), but we need to kill that supply route where we can, and make it Covid-secure where we can’t.  There is so much trade between the UK and continental Europe that closing the border is a challenge. The logistics will be tough, especially if it has to be done at lightning speed. And yet the one thing we have learned from the last miserable year is that the private sector is very good at adapting to change. We have all made huge sacrifices to bring Covid-19 under control in the UK. There is no point in simply re-importing it now  – but the economy needs to brace for that shock. "

Questor: Young’s is in good shape despite lockdowns with cash flow set to be positive by May
","
Questor Inheritance Tax Portfolio: when it begins pulling pints again next month, this pubs company expects to bounce back quickly
",Richard Evans,"
26 March 2021 • 5:00am
","A loss of 8pc on a share   doesn’t sound like much of a result – until you remember that for much of the past year the business has been unable to operate. The company in question may be called Young & Co’s Brewery but it brews no beer: since 2011, when it sold its brewery operations, it has been solely a pubs business and has therefore been all but dormant during the various lockdowns. Last week it told investors that it planned to open about 140 of its self-managed (as opposed to tenanted) pubs with outdoor space   the date on which the Government has said the current restriction should end. As of September last year the firm had 208 managed pubs and 64 tenanted ones. Assuming the   is followed, the rest of its managed pubs should open on or around May 17 with restricted indoor trading, “ultimately leading to the company operating under more normal trading conditions from June 21”, it said. It added that if the reopening schedule proceeded as planned, it expected to deliver positive cash flow in May. If achieved, this will in Questor’s book be a creditable result. The group has also agreed with its lenders an extension until next March of a revised way to assess its financial position: instead of being judged on its (currently non-existent) earnings Young’s will simply have to keep its debts below £230m. By next March we can hope it will have been trading normally for several months and will have no problems passing the earnings-based test. As part of its agreement with its lenders it will pay (as opposed to declare) no more than £5m in total in dividends in the financial year that begins on Tuesday. This would equate to 8.6p a share. The full-year dividend in 2019 was 21p. To pay any dividend in the circumstances would be quite an achievement in this column’s view. Young’s said it would repay in May £30m borrowed through the Covid Corporate Financing Facility, another welcome sign of financial health. It appears that the firm is well placed to emerge from the pandemic in good shape. It may even be in a position to buy up cheaply any pubs put on the market by less fortunate owners in need of cash. It’s more than two years since we last updated readers on  , which makes food supplements for animals, and in that time the shares have risen by about 126pc, although the gain since their addition to the Inheritance Tax Portfolio in June 2018 is a less spectacular 16pc. They did shed about 5pc on Wednesday last week when the company announced its annual results, even though the board described the firm’s operating performance as its “best to date”. No doubt some investors had expected even more, but the 5pc rise in sales to £30.5m, the 22pc increase in profits before tax to £5.4m and the 12.5pc lift to the annual dividend to 9p, assuming that shareholders approve the 6.25p final, were hardly the stuff of nightmares. Net cash at the year end rose from £13.8m last year to £15.8m, despite the £1m the firm spent to buy back its own shares. Conversion of profits into cash was roughly 100pc – normally a healthy sign in this column’s eyes. The strength of the results can be attributed in part to the company’s strategy in recent years to set up local subsidiaries and sales teams in overseas markets. It said this approach had proved its worth: growth had been strongest through these channels, “which have been able to fully support end customers throughout the pandemic”. In China a ban on the use of antibiotic growth promoters in animal feed also helped sales of Anpario’s Orego-Stim product. The firm said the current financial year had also started well. Analysts at Peel Hunt, the stockbroker, said: “We see good momentum in the business as producers focus on improving animal health, particularly as use of antibiotics has become more restricted. We have increased our target price from 650p to 685p to reflect the enhanced prospects.”    "

Questor: bargains to buy and stocks to sell in Europe’s third wave
","
Questor share tips: further lockdowns spell trouble for the continent’s economy but not every business will suffer
",Richard Evans,"
28 March 2021 • 5:00am
","Will this company survive? That was the question we were forced to ask of each of the stocks we had tipped this time last year, when the first wave of the pandemic put much of the economy into the deep freeze. Now, as Europe faces a third wave, we must ask the same question of businesses there. What will push a business under is the combination of a collapse in sales in an extended lockdown and high debts. Most at risk, unsurprisingly, are those in the travel and leisure sectors. Questor suspects that few readers own European stocks in such sectors but anyone who does should assess the risk of failure carefully and think about selling now to recover at least some money rather than hold on and risk a total loss. Pay particular attention to when debts fall due. It was already a bad time to be a bank – it’s hard to make money when interest rates are around zero – and lockdowns that threaten the solvency of customers make matters worse. With some exceptions, European banks are not a good place to be, although the authorities will probably ensure that none actually fail no matter how bad the third wave gets. We have tipped one in the past,  , and will take the opportunity to sell it now at what seems like a bearable loss in the circumstances of 8.7pc. At the opposite end of the spectrum are businesses that are strong enough to survive even an extended period without revenues. These are firms that have minimal debts and the prospect of a quick recovery as soon as their customers are allowed to buy their products again. Many can even expect to pick up market share as weaker rivals go to the wall. George Cooke, who manages Montanaro’s European Smaller Companies investment trust, said CTS Eventim, the ticket retailer, was a good example. “It’s had a torrid year but we have held it throughout. We think people will go wild to go to concerts again.” Large parts of the economy are able to function normally or even thrive during lockdowns. We’ve all seen how technology companies and home delivery services have prospered. So we need have no concerns about past Questor tips such as SAP, Prosus, which owns stakes in Tencent among other tech firms, Dassault Systèmes or Delivery Hero. Drugs makers and green energy companies are other winners and we have had the good fortune  , Novo Nordisk and Gerresheimer, which makes phials for vaccines. Other shockproof businesses include big consumer brands whose cachet gives them pricing power and hence high returns on capital and little need to borrow. Examples tipped here in the past include Rémy Cointreau and Hermès. Française des Jeux, which operates the French lottery, and Symrise, the flavours and fragrances company, are similarly insulated from the effects of lockdown. This time last year there were bargains everywhere as panicked investors sold indiscriminately. Bargain hunters have a harder time today. “Most trends have now become apparent and people have worked out what’s doing well or badly,” said Mr Cooke. “This is different from last March, when some stocks that initially sold off turned out to be winners.” This column turned to James Milne, manager of the Crux European fund, to identify a stock poised to enjoy a bounce. He named Vivendi, the French media conglomerate. “It’s the world’s biggest music publisher thanks to its ownership of Universal Music Group and as we all switch to streaming it makes more recurring revenues,” he said. Vivendi has decided that the market would give UMG a higher value if it had its own listing so  . “There is scarcity value in growth stocks in Europe so we expect UMG to do well as a separately listed business,” Mr Milne said. “Buying Vivendi now should give you a cheaper way into the company.”"

Exclusive: World leaders call for pandemic treaty

Boris Johnson, Emmanuel Macron and Angela Merkel propose global accord akin to that forged after Second World War
","Lucy Fisher, ","
30 March 2021 • 12:01am
","The world needs a global settlement like that forged after the Second World War to protect countries in the wake of Covid, Boris Johnson and other world leaders have said. , Mr Johnson, Emmanuel Macron, the French president, and Angela Merkel, the German chancellor, said the virus pandemic had been ""a stark and painful reminder that nobody is safe until everyone is safe"". Amid  , they called for an end to isolationism and nationalism in favour of a new era of solidarity. The   alongside Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, the World Health Organisation (WHO) chief, is made in The Telegraph and newspapers across the world including Le Monde in France, El Pais in Spain and Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung in Germany. The leaders said a treaty akin to the settlement forged in the aftermath of the war was needed to build cross-border co-operation ahead of  , describing Covid as ""the biggest challenge to the global community since the 1940s"". They wrote: ""At that time, following the devastation of two world wars, political leaders came together to forge the multilateral system. The aims were clear – to bring countries together, to dispel the temptations of isolationism and nationalism and to address the challenges that could only be achieved together in the spirit of solidarity and co-operation, namely peace, prosperity, health and security."" A treaty on pandemics ""should lead to more mutual accountability and shared responsibility, transparency and co-operation within the international system and with its rules and norms"", the leaders said. The joint article comes in the wake of deepening strain between Britain and the European Union  . The European Commission has threatened to block shipments of potentially millions of AstraZeneca jabs   following fury in Brussels about the company falling short in its deliveries so far this year. On Monday night, Mr Johnson   to ensure the resilience of the UK's domestic vaccine supply chains amid the threat of jabs trade wars. He announced that the Government's vaccine taskforce had   to ""fill and finish"" 60 million doses of   at a plant in Barnard Castle in the North-East. The agreement removes the need for doses of Novavax – which Mr Johnson called ""a potentially significant new weapon in our armoury against Covid"" – to be sent to Germany to be put in vials. A Downing Street source said the move was motivated in part by a desire to pour investment into the UK's domestic vaccine manufacturing capability, while also making the nation's vaccine supplies ""more secure"". The Novavax jab   and is expected to be approved by the UK medicines regulator in the coming weeks. It is expected that doses will start being processed in the UK from May. Mr Johnson acknowledged that Monday was a ""big day"" for many Britons as they were   for the first time since the most recent lockdown began in January. The Prime Minister stressed the ""importance of everybody maintaining the discipline people have shown for so long"" and warned that it was unclear ""how robust our defences are against another wave"". He  , but said he was ""hopeful"" that the one from which the country was beginning to emerge would be the last. He has been a leading advocate of   and last month directly petitioned fellow G7 leaders to back the proposal. The alliance agreed to ""explore the potential value"" of the idea, which is set to be discussed further at   in June. His emphasis on the need for better health data-sharing between countries follows concerns about China withholding information and access from global health inspectors as they  . On Monday it emerged that the long-awaited WHO report on the origins of the virus had concluded that a leak from a laboratory, while possible, was ""extremely unlikely"". The report,  , concluded that Covid was most likely to have been passed from bats via an ""intermediate animal host"" to humans before sparking an ""explosive outbreak"" in Wuhan in December 2019. The repeatedly delayed report was finally sent to all WHO member states on Sunday evening. The 123-page document presented detailed studies of morbidity, cases, pharmacy records, food samples and genetic sequencing from in and around Wuhan in late 2019, ""to better understand how the virus might have been introduced and started"". It found no firm evidence to distract from the already established idea that the pandemic started in Wuhan in or around that December, and that the Huanan wet market either sparked or ""amplified"" the outbreak. , the 24 world leaders warned that regardless of the origins of the outbreak, a future global pandemic was an inevitability. The group, also including Charles Michel, the European Council president, Mark Rutte, the Dutch prime minister, and the presidents of South Africa, South Korea, Indonesia, Tunisia and Senegal, said the key question was not ""if but when"" the next health crisis would strike. They warned that ""no single government or multilateral agency can address this threat alone"", arguing: ""Together, we must be better prepared to predict, prevent, detect, assess and effectively respond to pandemics in a highly co-ordinated fashion."" Other central aims of a pandemic agreement would be to enhance international co-operation around alert systems, data-sharing and research, as well as the local, regional and global production and distribution of vaccines, medicines, diagnostics and personal protective equipment. It comes as governments engage in fresh rounds of talks about the prospect of a pact ahead of health ministers convening at the World Health Assembly in May. A resolution outlining plans for the WHO to strengthen its pandemic preparedness and response framework is set to be tabled at the meeting, along with a proposal for a working group to negotiate an international treaty. The world leaders' proposed new treaty would be rooted in the constitution of the WHO, which could draw in other relevant organisations, and would support the principle of ""health for all"". The International Health Regulations and other existing global health frameworks would underpin the treaty, ensuring ""a firm and tested foundation"". ""At a time when Covid-19 has exploited our weaknesses and divisions, we must seize this opportunity and come together as a global community for peaceful cooperation that extends beyond this crisis,"" the leaders said. ""Building our capacities and systems to do this will take time and require a sustained political, financial and societal commitment over many years."""

From comedy to current affairs, true crime to fake agony aunts – our critics on the shows that bring joy to life in lockdown
",,"
24 March 2021 • 1:51pm
","Comedians Joe Wilkinson, David Earl and Poppy Hillstead read out ridiculous childhood gossip and absurd local rumours from listeners. It’s not only hilarious –  there’s also something oddly nostalgic about it. Superb music and sound design too. S2 Ep4: Kiri Pritchard-McLean In which America’s greatest character comic inhabits a succession of evil men: a deviant off-Broadway producer; a sadistic 91-year-old personal trainer to the stars; a devil-worshipping game show host. Daly does it so amiably you’ll come to love them all.  Hail Satan with Chip Gardner Julia Davis and Vicky Pepperdine’s perverted middle-aged agony aunts are easily the filthiest comedy duo since Derek & Clive. Their advice couldn’t be worse, but much of the joy comes from hearing these two gross-out masters each doing her best to be more wrong than the other.  S1 Ep One This self-contained universe of recurring characters and insanely committed improv can be baffling for first-time listeners. But when it clicks – usually when impressionist Paul F Tompkins is doing his Andrew Lloyd Webber or Werner Herzog act – there’s nothing funnier.  #229 Two Thumbs & Not Much Else Three storytelling stand-up shows from one of Australia’s most intelligent comedians, in binaural 3D sound: close your eyes, and it’s just like being in the comedy club. The Resistance, about her childhood in a kind of informal Buddhist commune, is particularly delightful.  03 The Resistance Act 1 Prolific podcaster Alice Fraser (again!) hops between satire and surrealism so deftly in these daily topical dispatches, you start to lose track of the difference between the two. Andy Zaltzman, Tiff Stevenson and Nish Kumar are among the regular contributors.  64. Future TV news This high-concept, deadpan comedy was picked up by Radio 4 after becoming a word-of-mouth hit. It’s ostensibly the podcast offshoot of a dry journal about dairy farming, but each episode soon descends into freewheeling surrealism.  Episode 5 – Dustin France If you’re confined to your sickbed, why not share it with Patrick Marber and Peter Curran? Each bite-sized episode of this gently charming BBC series finds the writers on the verge of sleep, swapping murmured, meandering banter about life.  Happiness, small birds and Spike Milligan Fed up with earnest, luvvie-ish interview podcasts? Comedian David Reed skewers the format: in his interviews with fellow comics, the only rule is that every answer must be a lie. His chats with Marcus Brigstocke, Miles Jupp and Rufus Hound are improvisational gold.  4.1 – Rufus Hound From the team behind quiz show QI, this weekly podcast combines witty chatter with joyfully abstruse trivia. Where else could you learn what kind of liquor lemurs like, or hear about a robot built to replace the Duke of York?  Episode 312: No Such Thing as Quentin Tarantino’s Bambi Elis James and John Robins record their video chats and play games in the time of coronavirus lockdown. It’s funny, friendly and listening to it feels like hanging out with pals.  #51: Clock on, clock off David Runciman, Helen Thompson and a cast of talking heads explore a political topic du jour. The hosts, academics by trade, don’t rush to conclusions: the mechanics behind ideas, parties and events are unfurled and teased out at length.  215 What’s the Future for Labour? Dasha and Anna, two New York “bohemian layabouts”, drawl their way, in chaotic style, through the state of contemporary culture and politics. Good things: Slavoj Žižek, Bernie Sanders. Bad things: #MeToo (“sexual jihad”), Hillary Clinton, Jameela Jamil.  Shame Theory The Telegraph’s chief political correspondent Christopher Hope manages the difficult balancing act of being at once chummy and challenging in his interviews. His weekly podcast is usually recorded in Westminter’s Red Lion pub, but is currently (and quite sensibly) coming from his front room.   Jeremy Corbyn on the Coronavirus response, leadership regrets and being a backbench rebel Another entry in the flourishing “women in a room talking” podcast genre, but what women they are. Twice a week from Sydney, two Aussies and one Brit argue about the news with a wit and open-mindedness often lacking in similar shows. No topic is too shallow or too serious, and the episodes covering Australia’s bushfire crisis were exemplary.  Why I Didn’t Like Your Instagram Post Short, sharp, regular: Stephen Bush, Anoosh Chakelian and co provide a weekly survey of British politics. Occasionally there’s a cultural angle, though mostly it’s news through and through. Bush dominates the airtime, but the quiet gem is the magazine’s political correspondent Ailbhe Rea.  The Cabinet of Dr Keirstarmi Of course you don’t much care about the lives of D-list celebrities or bottom-feeding influencers, and nor do the hosts of this entertainingly disdainful podcast dedicated to their movements. The regular “What’s Rita Ora up to?” segment is a joy.  Spencer Pratt?   Journalist Oz Katerji tackles a different theme in each episode as he looks at what went wrong for Jeremy Corbyn in the general election last year, with input from journalists and political figures.   4: The 2019 General Election Defeat The team behind Brexitcast have turned their show into a coronavirus news programme. Presenter Adam Fleming and correspondents find some refreshing perspectives on events, including store-cupboard baking tips with Nadiya Hussain and Nigella Lawson, and advice on home haircuts from pro hairdresser Nicky Clarke.  STAY AT HOME! The American President’s numerous vested interests – some obvious, many less so – are given the sunlight-is-the-best-disinfectant treatment in this punchy investigative series. It’s like a conspiracy thriller unfolding live.  The Family Business From pre-code puritanism to Manson-era excess, LA journalist Karina Longworth combs Hollywood history for scandal, long-forgotten cautionary tales and epic power struggles.   Bette Davis and the Hollywood Canteen   Half-hour portions of starry Hollywood shop talk, recorded live at the Directors Guild of America’s Los Angeles HQ.  Knives Out with Rian Johnson and Denis Villeneuve (Ep 241) British actor and comedian Brett Goldstein asks his guests to reflect on the movies that changed their lives from an imagined posthumous perspective. The conceit is not (quite) as morbid as it sounds, and it makes for unusually heartfelt and spontaneous conversation.  Claudia O’Doherty #53 The staff of website The Ringer host a nerdy discussion of films people love enough to watch hundreds of times.  The Devil Wears Prada Join superfan Michael Leader and newcomer Jake Cunningham on a stroll through the films of Japanese animation house Studio Ghibli. Knowledgable, wry and unexpectedly soothing, it’s ideally pitched for buffs and novices alike.  Spirited Away #1 The secret to the BBC’s best-loved film show isn’t the wit and passion of Mark Kermode’s criticism nor the ease of Simon Mayo’s hosting, but its fusing of the two into a once-a-generation double act.  John Turturro, Four Kids and It and The Whalebone Box Hilariously obsessive – and entirely merited – minute-by-minute analysis of Michael Mann’s near-three-hour LA crime opus Heat. Critic Blake Howard swaps theories and insights with fellow obsessives, culminating with Mann himself.  Episode #30 – Manohla Dargis Convivial weekly chats hosted by Edith Bowman about the vibrant relationship between cinema and music. Bowman wears her deep knowledge lightly.  Episode 155: Quentin Tarantino on the Music of Once Upon a Time in Hollywood Bit-part players tell host Matt Gourley what it was like to be a victim in Silence of The Lambs, or a passenger on the Speed bus.  The Exorcist with Eileen Dietz (on Stitcher Premium) Stig Abell, TLS editor, lends his blokey enthusiasm to rounding up the week in books and the arts more widely. It can all sound a little too eager, but the variety of coverage, from internet literature to visual art, is superb.  Prize controversies Each daily episode is a five-minute nugget of poetry presented by Tracy K Smith, the former US poet laureate. The readings mix the canonical with the contemporary, from Jackie Kay and Jay Bernard to William Carlos Williams and more.  171: Spring Morning by A A Milne Helen Zaltzman’s long-running podcast about language is always enlightening and often very funny. Some of the topics she chews over include why people change their names; how meteorologists choose the right words to describe weather; and whether swearing is good for you.   95. Verisimilitude  A series of lively conversations on writing and reading chaired by The Spectator’s literary editor Sam Leith, full of warmth, wit and easy-going erudition. Whoever the guest of the week happens to be, you will feel better-read just for having eavesdropped. Piers Torday on the magic of children’s books This series caused controversy recently after Booker Prize winner Marlon James and his editor Jake Morrissey made devastating assessments of, among others, Charlotte Brontë. It may raise your hackles, but there is something bracing in its revisionism, too.  Trashy Novels to Die For    A simple format that brings the best out of its contributors: each month a guest poet chooses a poem they love and unpicks it line by line with The New Yorker’s poetry editor (Kevin Young, or in earlier episodes Paul Muldoon).   Nick Laird reads Elizabeth Bishop The archive of this seminal annual lecture series, from 1948-2019, is available as a podcast. Highlights include Daniel Barenboim on music, Grayson Perry on art and Atul Gawande on medicine, but start with Hilary Mantel’s talks on historical fiction.  Can These Bones Live? Radio 3’s “cabaret of the word” features fiction, poetry, music and snippets of drama, as well as chat between guests such as Eimear McBride and Tim Minchin. Yorkshire poet Ian McMillan is the avuncular host.   Novels that Shaped Our Language   This terrific podcast features Gyles Brandreth and Countdown’s Susie Dent exploring different words and phrases with strange etymologies. Namby-pamby, the blind leading the blind, grockle… Each is discussed in a light-hearted, whip-smart way.  Boycott If you are unable to sleep because you have listened to something really gripping, here is the antidote. Intentionally soporific readings from books on a variety of subjects including Bad Drains and How to Test Them.  The Coming of the Fairies by Arthur  Conan Doyle Spicy, opinionated and with a superb rugby brain, The Telegraph’s Brian Moore chats with the great and the good of the game. If you love your rugby, there are few better commentators.  Brian Moore: Playing behind closed doors is better than nothing   For football fans of a certain age, this is irresistible. Comedian Josh Widdicombe – with friends Michael Marden and Chris Scull – interviews footballers from the Nineties, who inevitably come with a kitbag of hair-raising stories.  John Moncur: S04 E07   Sam Delaney and Andy Dawson, the hosts, claim this isn’t a football podcast (it started off as one, then drifted), but while their general output is entertaining, the real gold lies in their hilarious “deep dives” into the autobiographies of Roy Keane and Kevin Keegan.  The Keane Odyssey –  Part 2   Presented by “three average cricketers who never quite made it”, The Grade Cricketer is a witty and very Australian take on all things leather and willow. Yes, they get big names in to talk to, but the soul of the podcast is in the grassroots. One for village cricketers everywhere.  81. Oh. My. God.    This one really isn’t a football podcast, though it started off that way, with comedian Bob Mortimer and his friend and long-suffering Sunderland fan Andy Dawson (him again). What this really is, is a vehicle for Mortimer’s brilliant and surreal comic mind. It’s some of his best work.  Ep. 41 – Meet Barry Homeowner   Peter Crouch and friends exchange fun anecdotes from the world of sport, and talk about such things as the nonsense footballers say to each other in the tunnel, dressing room etiquette, and the dos and don’ts of goal celebrations.  That Houses Episode   An oddball trio of BBC Radio 1 DJ Greg James, England fast-bowling titan Jimmy Anderson and indie guitarist Felix White of the Maccabees indulge their love of cricket and all its quirks. It’s joyous, silly and welcoming even to cricket novices.  The Best Day Ever Comedy? Poetry? Social history? Philosophy? You could file these gnomic circadian musings from Yorkshire writer and stand-up Rob Auton under all of the above. In truth, though, they’re a podcast category unto themselves; concise, intriguing and cherishably odd.  Ep73: Lego Truths The internet is a jungle, full of dangers and curios. Every week, hosts P J Vogt and Alex Goldman investigate its weirdest, deepest recesses, from child hackers to vanished pop songs and creepy surveillance software.  #158: The Case of the Missing Hit Alie Ward interviews specialists in extremely specific things. So you get to find out all about the work of spidroinologists (experts in the properties of spider webs), ludologists (games), corvid thanatologists (the death rituals of crows, of course) and many more.  Astrobiology (ALIENS) with Kevin Peter Hand Compilation of the best of the underrated CBeebies radio channel aimed at under-sixes, including audio adaptations of Postman Pat, Andy’s Adventures, Peter Rabbit and Biggleton’s Big News. If you are not a parent of a young child, this will mean little to you, but if you are, it’s ideal to put on as an alternative to screen time.  Andy’s Sound Adventures, British Woodland The ghosts of Black Mirror and Blue Jam haunt this anthology of 10 strange tales, each one told in a collage of conversational snatches and ambient sound. It’s ideal bedtime listening: headphones and a dark room are a must.  1: Over and Out A troupe of actors, comedians and musicians adapt ideas written by children into hilarious sketches. A riotous, child-focused and very silly family podcast, Story Pirates encourages kids to flex their creative writing muscles to come up with more madcap stories for the team to act out.  The Girl Who Turned into Spaghetti Anything goes in poet Ross Sutherland’s wonderful, but erratically released podcast: ambient music, an experimental documentary about washing machines, a spoof of The Exorcist, a cut-up poem made from clips of John Humphrys on the Today programme. Oh, and he teaches a computer to do stand-up comedy.  45 S.E.I.N.F.E.L.D. Why did Ed Sheeran become famous and how does Adele write her songs? Co-hosted by  Straight Up talks to the gatekeepers of UK music: from Grammy-winning producer Fraser T Smith to Ed Sheeran's manager Stuart Camp.  Straight Up with BBC Introducing founder Jason Carter Rolling Stone’s weekly deep dive into some of rock and country’s most cherished musicians and their back catalogues is a must-listen for music lovers who can’t stand the new school of SoundCloud rappers and bubblegum pop.  Woodstock at 50: The Untold Stories Enjoy sparkling music journalism without a hint of snootiness from the pop music team at The New York Times, who spend an hour a week sinking their teeth into the kind of quirky music debates you won’t see in the news.  What’s the point of album covers in a post-album era? Matthew Bannister meets folk musicians (including the Young’uns, the Unthanks and Peggy Seeger) and explores the landscapes that matter to them. The musicians play acoustic songs on location against a backdrop of babbling rivers and rustling leaves. Restorative and beautiful.  The Unthanks on the Northumberland Coast The prime-time polymath turns his hand to classical music for children in this exuberantly silly educational series: think Horrible Histories with harpsichords. An eclectic syllabus takes in everything from Mozart to Ethel Smyth and John Williams’s Star Wars scores.  Episode 7: Beethoven This is the kind of hyper-specific idea that podcasts have created a space for: two musicians, Martin Zaltz Austwick and Sam Pay, analyse every single song in Tom Waits’s enormous discography, tackling one per episode, with help from less-obsessed guests (including writers and artists). This is unashamedly pitched at Waits superfans.   Black Wings, Bone Machine, Tom Waits [199] A history of the Beatles made by the Liverpool Echo, telling the story of Beatlemania, with the help of people who were really there. And I mean really there: Paul McCartney talks about his childhood home and Pete Best recalls his drumming days.  Sir Paul McCartney Telegraph columnist Bryony Gordon talks to the great and the good about mental health. Their frank conversations often generate headlines – not least her revelatory interview with the Duke of Sussex.  Prince Harry Celebrity-on-celebrity podcasts are now inescapable, but this is the original. Perpetually ticked-off comedian Maron’s vast archive of funny, revealing chats with presidents and Hollywood greats proves he is one of the best interviewers around.  Episode 67: Robin Williams   A famous cultural figure, such as Jackie Kay, Lemn Sissay or Cariad Lloyd, guides a friend around their favourite museum. Each episode is a beguiling and friendly half-hour.  Lemn Sissay at the Foundling Museum   Fans of Thought for the Day will know how punchy and persuasive the good reverend Fraser can be. Here, guests including Mary Beard and the late Roger Scruton talk about their beliefs.  Charles Moore’s Confessions – Thatcher, theology and the Tories   Writer Scarlett Curtis speaks to Keira Knightley, Lena Dunham, Zoella and others about what modern feminism means to them.   Keira Knightley   Comedian Cariad Lloyd talks with fellow comics and writers, such as Robert Webb, David Baddiel and Sara Pascoe about their own experiences of bereavement and thoughts on “the weirdness of death and dying”.   Ep 18: Emily Dean   Elizabeth Day interviews literary figures and invites them to recall three times they have “failed”. Guests include Phoebe Waller-Bridge, Sebastian Faulks, Olivia Laing and Gina Miller, and the failures recounted range from broken-down relationships to disappointing cricket matches.   S1, Ep1 Phoebe Waller-Bridge    Elis James and John Robins (yes, them again) ask a famous name to discuss how they dealt with a traumatic episode. Eye-opening.  #4 – Tom Bradby: ‘The mental health equivalent of a heart attack’   By writers, with writers, for writers. Each episode is a one-on-one conversation with a writer of longform pieces. Whether it is sports writing or tech journalism, over a gentle, probing hour, you learn how they do it.  #297: Elif Batuman   How did Joaquin Phoenix lose all that weight for his Oscar-winning role in Joker and how would Winston Churchill have handled coronavirus?

Young Sherlock Holmes was ahead of its time – why did the Conan Doyle purists hate it?

The Spielberg production was a superhero origin story, a VFX marvel, and one of the darkest children's films ever made. But it wasn't Holmes
",Tom Fordy,"

","At just 18 years old, actor Nicholas Rowe got to live a dream scenario for any Eighties movie fan – hanging out at the headquarters of Steven Spielberg’s Amblin Entertainment, in the backlot of Universal Studios, playing video games and watching movies.  “I remember playing video games while standing next to Bob Zemeckis,” laughs Rowe, recalling his brush with the director of Back to the Future and  . It was 1985, and Rowe had been cast as the lead in the Amblin-produced adventure, Young . It was the absolute peak moment for Amblin’s output – three years after ET and Poltergeist, a year after Gremlins, and the same year as The Goonies and Back to the Future.  Behind Young Sherlock was a team of Hollywood heavyweights; the film was executive produced by Spielberg, directed by Barry Levinson, and written by Chris Columbus. But Rowe, now 54, admits that he wasn’t up to date on his Spielberg adventures. “I hadn’t seen ET by that time,” he says, “which was a shock to one of the Spielberg people working at Amblin. They said, ‘Don’t tell Steven that! Just sit in the movie theatre and we’ll set it up.’ So I sat and watched ET on my own in this 30-seater theatre, with some popcorn from the machine, and the controls and a phone right by me. I had everything I needed. I was thinking life doesn’t get better than this.” A sound knowledge of Eighties cinema was likely imperative. Young Sherlock Holmes is pure Amblin fodder – a coming-of-age adventure with gadgets, little monsters, and Spielbergian spirit. A Victorian Goonies, perhaps. It’s no great mystery: Chris Columbus wrote Gremlins and The Goonies – both were executive produced by Spielberg. What Young Sherlock Holmes isn’t – in a purist-ruffling irony – is a Sherlock Holmes story. Departing from what Sherlockians call “the canon” – the four novels and 56 short stories by  e – it’s more of a swashbuckling Indiana Jones adventure, with ancient evil rituals and industry-changing SFX. “Most Holmesians are, as you might expect, infuriated by the many sizeable liberties the film takes,” says Adrian Braddy, editor of Sherlock Holmes Magazine. “It repeatedly and spectacularly contradicts the canon.” The composite of ideas might explain why Young Sherlock Holmes was a high profile dud for Amblin – even at the height of the mighty Spielberg’s powers. Still, Young Sherlock Holmes holds strong nostalgia for kids of the Eighties. “I am aware that it has a strong place in people’s hearts,” says Nicholas Rowe. “It will probably always have a place somewhere in a cult collection.” The idea of a young Sherlock Holmes wasn’t new. Though not a Holmes story, Buster Keaton imagined himself as a chip of the old Sherlock in the 1924 silent classic, Sherlock Jr. In 1982, ITV aired the largely-forgotten series Young Sherlock: The Mystery of Manor House, starring Guy Henry as the adolescent sleuth. Now, it’s a common theme. There’s a series of Young Sherlock novels by Andrew Lane, and this week Netflix launches a new Sherlock-based teen series,  featuring The Inbetweeners’   as a grungy, emo Holmes. The mid-Eighties was a curious time for Holmes on screen. In 1984, Granada launched the  -starring series – largely considered to be the definitive, most faithful screen version (Brett carried a copy of the canon at all times to ensure fidelity) – and in 1986, Disney released its anthropomorphised version, The Great Mouse Detective. Chris Columbus wanted to pick apart the emotionless core of Sherlock, by reimagining him as a love-struck teenager. He wrote The Goonies by day, and Young Sherlock Holmes by night. “The thing that was most important to me was why Holmes became so cold and calculating, and why he was alone for the rest of his life,'” Columbus told the New York Times. “That's why he is so emotional in the film. As a youngster, he was ruled by emotion, he fell in love with the love of his life, and as a result of what happens in this film, he becomes the person he was later.” It’s dodgy ground even now. Last year the estate of Doyle   for giving Sherlock emotions in Enola Holmes – itself a gender-swap play on Young Sherlock. Columbus commented that he was “very worried about offending some of the Holmes purists”. When Paramount head Michael Eisner green-lit the film, it offended the ultimate Holmes purist: Dame Jean Conan Doyle, the daughter of Sir Arthur. “When Dame Jean read the script, she was aghast at the violent imagery that was intended for young viewers,” says Gus Holwerda, co-host of the Jeremy Brett Sherlock Holmes Podcast. “She was also unhappy at some of the choices that had been written into her father’s characters. As the executor of the Doyle canon, she refused to allow the film to go forward without significant changes. Eisner listened to her concerns, took her council to heart, and hired Sherlockian scholar John Bennett Shaw and novelist Jeffery Archer to revise the script.” (The film is bookended with clunky disclaimers, explaining that it’s not taken from Doyle’s stories, but it's “affectionate speculation” about what Holmes’ youth could have been.) By that point, Barry Levinson’s films had been low-key character dramas – Diner and The Natural. But Spielberg saw Levinson as “a frustrated action-adventure director”. Later, Levinson would direct Good Morning Vietnam, Rain Man (which won four Oscars), and Sleepers. In a 1993 book on his career, Levinson recalled that he was drawn to the Victorian setting (the film was shot around Oxford, various castle locations, and Elstree Studios) and working with child actors, though it was hard finding a solid cast of 16-year-old actors. Levinson looked at audition tapes for 10,000 boys. Nicholas Rowe recalls going for a screen test, along with other young actors who were up for the part. “Hugh Grant was there,” laughs Rowe. “And look what happened to him.” In the film, young Watson (Alan Cox) enrolls at Brompton Academy, where he befriends Holmes. Sherlock shows off his powers of deduction by determining the portly Watson’s favourite tarts, based on the custard stains down his lapel. Along with Elizabeth (Sophie Ward) – Holmes’ doomed sweetheart – they investigate a series of bizarre deaths. Victims are shot with poisoned blow darts and driven to suicide by monstrous hallucinations, including a reanimated roast pheasant and an assortment of come-to-life cakes and confectionary (created by stop-motion and puppetry techniques). The film veers into dark territory as the trio uncovers an Egyptian death cult, practicing human sacrifice shenanigans in a hidden underground pyramid. The latter scene is uncannily like Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom (also released in 1984). It was a common criticism at the time – though the script was written before Temple of Doom was released. “It was a mistake on our behalf, because we hadn’t seen [Temple of Doom] before it opened,” wrote Levinson. Presumably, though, executive producer Steven Spielberg had seen Temple of Doom, considering he, erm, directed it. In the end, Sherlock’s fencing tutor, Professor Rathe (Anthony Higgins) – who teaches Sherlock the invaluable lesson of “never replace discipline with emotions” – is not what he seems to be, which leads to a rousing sword fight on a frozen Thames.  The conclusion of the film is unexpectedly bleak: Sherlock’s first love takes a bullet for him. But faithful to the canon or not, Young Sherlock Holmes is a rollicking adventure.  “As is the case with many fandoms, a good number of Holmes purists eschew any form of pastiche,” says Gus Holwerda. “I typically count myself among such curmudgeons. But this film is an exception – for me, at least.” Watched now, it feels ahead of the curve as a piece of blockbuster cinema: a superhero origin story designed to jump-start a franchise (we find out background details such as how Holmes got the deerstalker, pipe, and his “elementary” catchphrase).  With a budget of $18 million, it cost just marginally less than Raiders of the Lost Ark. “The production design was amazing,” says Rowe. “The scale of it was there to behold when you walked onto the set. You could see they were ambitious for it, and were throwing money at it. There was a real buzz around the studio. Labyrinth was being made next door!” With its fantastical mystery and boarding school setting – combined with Watson as the bespectacled new boy – it’s now most obviously like Harry Potter. Indeed, Chris Columbus would direct the first two Harry Potter movies. “Little did I know it would turn out to be a primer for the Potter films,” Columbus told The Telegraph in 2013. Young Sherlock Holmes was also a landmark moment for effects, thanks to the wizards from SFX pioneers at Industrial Light & Magic. It was the first live action film to feature a fully computer generated 3D character – a sword-wielding knight who leaps out of a stained glass window and terrifies a poor vicar to death. The “stained glass man” was created by future Toy Story director John Lasseter and visual effects supervisor Dennis Muren. It took them six months to make 31 seconds of footage. The computer that made it was dubbed “the Pixar machine”. The film was ultimately nominated for the Best Visual Effects Academy Award, but cruelly lost out to geriatric glow-fest Cocoon. For another sequence – one that would be easily CGI’d these days – Nicholas Rowe and Alan Cox found themselves strapped into a Chitty Chitty Bang Bang-style flying machine (a make-believe anachronism that would rile the Holmes traditionalists) high above the set at Elstree. “The wind was up and there was a lot of shouting going on,” says Rowe. “I have a decent head for heights, but at that point I remember thinking, ‘What am I doing? This whole thing is insane.’” Also ahead of its time was the inclusion of a post-credits teaser – now a standard sign-off for mega-budget franchise films. “A lot of people didn’t stay for the credits,” says Nicholas Rowe. “Serves them right. It’s a nice little scene!” The teaser reveals Holmes’ arch-nemesis Moriarty – the set up for a sequel that never happened. Rowe confirms there were indeed big plans. “We had a potential three picture contract,” he says. “They were waiting to see how the first film did…” Like Holmes inspecting a scuffed shoe, it wouldn’t be Sherlock fandom without picking apart what the film gets right and wrong in forensic detail. For Adrian Braddy from Sherlock Holmes Magazine, the biggest liberty is the early meeting of Holmes and Watson. “Even as a child, I found it deeply distracting that Holmes was friends with Watson when they were schoolboys,” he says. “The most casual observer surely knows the duo met while grown men – nearly 20 years later, in A Study in Scarlet [the first Holmes novel, published in 1887].” Also, there’s Sherlock’s canon-contradicting romance. Arthur Conan Doyle’s Sherlock is often unimpressed by women – except Irene Adler, whom he admires for matching his intellect in the 1891 short story, A Scandal in Bohemia. As Watson said: “There was but one woman to him, and that woman was the late Irene Adler.” With its Holmesian affectations and bumbling version of Dr Watson – not the physical, intelligent military man of Doyle’s stories – Young Sherlock Holmes is perhaps more a tribute to the popular image of Holmes, best remembered from the classic Basil Rathbone films from 1939-1946. “A lot of the references and the stuff that’s explained in the film doesn’t come from the canon,” says Braddy. “The deerstalker, the pipe, the cloak, and the ‘Elementary, my dear Watson’. None of those elements appear in the original stories. It’s an origin story for the Rathbone films rather than the real Holmes.” There is some nice attention to Holmes canon and lore, however, such as young Sherlock’s enthusiasm for fencing (taken from a line in Doyle’s The Adventure of the Gloria Scott) and Sherlock’s violin playing (though his younger self needs some practice). As with the original stories, the adventure is narrated by Watson. Also present are a number of actors from other Sherlock adaptations, most notably Nigel Stock as young Holmes’ mentor, Professor Waxflatter. Stock played Watson in the BBC series from the Sixties, alongside both Douglas Wilmer and Peter Cushing as Sherlock. Nicholas Rowe is also a fine choice for a traditional-style Holmes. “He plays the part with the perfect mixture of arrogance, superiority, aloofness and an evolving brilliance,” says Adrian Braddy. Rowe – who hasn’t seen the film in 35 years – is more critical. “I don’t remember being blown away by my own performance,” he says. “I think there are moments where you spot a man learning on the job. It’s quirky. But I love the film.” (Rowe would briefly reprise a version of the role in 2015, in the Ian McKellen-starring Mr Holmes.) Released on December 4, 1985, Young Sherlock Holmes made a disappointing $20 million in the US. “I don’t think they quite knew how to sell it,” says Nicholas Rowe. “It was a strange mishmash. It just didn’t do well at the box office.” “I think the reason the film failed is the same reason it impressed me,” says Gus Holwerda. “It was, frankly, an adult film targeted at children. Virgin sacrifices by an Egyptian cult? Nightmarish hallucinations of terror? The heartbreaking death of the innocent, female lead? Such things were not standard fare in kid flicks of the Eighties.” Away from the classic American suburbia of Amblin’s movies from the era, there's perhaps a disconnect in its English Victorian setting – a Spielbergian film that's far from home. Nicholas Rowe recalls that Spielberg himself was a fan. “I was doing a play on Broadway and he turned up afterwards,” says Rowe. “He told me that he still had a massive soft spot for the film. It was one of his kids’ favourites.” Young Sherlock Holmes gained popularity on the small screen – through VHS and television repeats. “It felt like it was on all the time!” laughs Adrian Braddy.  That it holds up as an adventure, and remains a curious entry into Holmesian lore, is a nod to the brilliance of Sherlock Holmes and Dr Watson. “There are the traditionalists who think the canon is sacred and shouldn’t be messed with,” says Adrian Braddy. “But that’s the great thing about these characters. You can play around a little bit and put them into other film genres – into that Indiana Jones-style of adventure.”"

","The show will go on… soon! According to the   out of lockdown,   with socially distanced audiences from around May 17 (or Step 3), and with full audiences from June 21 (Step 4). Many shows, including new and returning West End productions, are already announcing their runs, and you can start booking now.  Just bear in mind that the exact reopening dates aren’t yet set in stone, so you might need to be flexible about swapping to another performance if Government plans change. We will keep this guide updated, so do check back for the latest information. Producer Nica Burns plans to reopen her West End theatres as soon as she’s allowed, with Step 3. Today, it was announced that the Lyric - current home of the witty, herstory musical Six, in which the wives of Henry VIII each get their say, diva style - is definitely returning in May with 50 per cent audience capacity and social distancing. The show’s devoted fans, known as the ‘Queendom’, will give them a right royal welcome back.  Likewise, the reopening of Nimax venues means the imminent return of this homegrown hit. The show is based on a real story about a teenager who wanted to wear a dress to his school dance, and features music by The Feeling’s Dan Gillespie Sells. There’s also a film adaptation coming soon, starring Richard E Grant as the drag queen mentor. The West End stalwart is taking bookings from May 17 - one the biggest productions to potentially aim for that early reopening date - although you might be safest opting for late June onwards. Stephen Schwartz’s musical tells the ‘untold’ tale of the Witches of Oz, anchored by the opposites-attract friendship between Elphaba and Glinda. The plucky Cornish outdoor theatre was quick off the mark in 2020, and looks to repeat the feat  , with events programmed from May. They include concerts from Fishermen's Friends and Scott Matthews, play And Then Come the Nightjars, and family fare like The Further Adventures of Doctor Dolittle.  You can once again experience Agatha Christie's taut thriller in this atmospheric, site-specific production, where you really feel like you’re in the courtroom where the drama takes place. Will you find Leonard Vole innocent or guilty of murder – and can you figure out who’s telling the truth? Pit your wits against the Queen of Crime. The Globe, which missed out on its summer season last year, is welcoming audiences back – amidst Covid-safe measures like having chairs in the Yard instead of milling crowds. Artistic director Michelle Terry will play Viola in Twelfth Night, directed by Sean Holmes, while Ola Ince directs Alfred Enoch and Rebekah Murrell in Romeo & Juliet. The French Revolutionary musical returns, initially with an encore of its 2020  , and then the full production from September 25. The cast features Jon Robyns, Bradley Jaden, Lucie Jones, Shan Ako and Josefina Gabrielle, delivering heart-pounding numbers like I Dreamed A Dream, Do You Hear The People Sing? and Bring Him Home.   Joining Les Mis in the West End is another popular French musical. Amélie, based on the quirky 2001 romcom, sees the titular character improvising small acts of kindness, and finding her own chance of happiness through love. It ran at The Other Palace in 2019, and stars the Olivier-nominated Audrey Brisson, leading an actor-musician cast. Fans of the Channing Tatum film franchise, and of male exotic dance, will be delighted to learn that this stage spin-off is back in action - albeit with social distancing, at least initially. This is enlightened striptease with acrobatics, knowing role play, and variety-style entertainment. For ages 18 and up. The north London venue has announced its first live productions for 2021. In the main house is Alfred Fagon's compelling and still resonant play, which tackles identity and sexual politics (from May 28). In the downstairs space is the premiere of Deborah Bruce's Raya (from June 11), set at a student reunion. The National reopens two of its spaces in June. First, on June 2, it's After Life in the Dorfman, based on the film by Hirokazu Kore-eda, written by Jack Thorne and directed by Jeremy Herrin. Then, on June 16, Dylan Thomas's Under Milk Wood begins in the Olivier, with Michael Sheen leading the company and Lyndsey Turner directing. The ABBA musical is still going strong, having spawned two movies and a ‘party’ spin-off at the O2 - plus a UK tour planned for January 2022, and open-air run at Harewood House in August. This sunny show doubles as a getaway, transporting you to a Greek island packed with family drama. But the story is really just an excuse for wall-to-wall pop hits that satisfy your inner dancing queen. Trevor Nunn directs Lisa Dwan in this 60th-anniversary production of Samuel Beckett’s play. Featuring a couple trapped together, struggling to combat the monotony of their days and understand the passing of time amidst surreal circumstances, it will likely take on new resonance post-lockdown.  Mischief Theatre's enduring farce is returning to the West End, ready to leave audiences helpless with laughter once more. The riotous comedy sees the am-dram Cornley Drama Society staging a 1920s murder mystery – but everything that can go wrong, does. Cue misplaced props, stuck doors, flubbed dialogue, injuries, and even the floor collapsing. The west London theatre reopens its doors with a triple bill of new work by Simon Stephens, Tanika Gupta and Roy Williams, exploring themes of race, identity, place and purpose. The plays will be helmed by the Lyric’s artistic director, Rachel O’Riordan, and Diane Page. This Olivier Award-winning musical tells the remarkable true story of passengers whose planes were grounded on 9/11, and the residents of a small Newfoundland town who welcomed them into their hearts and homes. It’s the best of humanity in the worst of times: the perfect post-pandemic outing.  You can’t stop the beat! Originally due to run in April 2020, this revival of the big-haired and big-hearted Sixties-set musical finally hits the stage this summer. Michael Ball is reprising his Olivier Award-winning turn as Edna Turnblad, and Paul Merton makes his West End debut as husband Wilbur. Sir Ian McKellen plays Shakespeare's prince, 50 years after he first tackled the role, and then Firs in Chekhov's Cherry Orchard, as part of a company staging both productions back to back. Also joining him are Steven Berkoff, Jenny Seagrove and Francesca Annis, directed by Sian Mathias. Beware the Trunchbull - one of the most terrifying villains in all of children’s literature. Thankfully, she has a hero to match in the form of the imaginative and magical Matilda. This RSC production captures Roald Dahl’s anarchic spirit, particularly via Tim Minchin’s mischievous songs. Mark Goucher Productions has announced two musical tours beginning in the summer. Hairspray begins in Plymouth on June 24, while Priscilla - which paused mid-run in 2020, and is co-produced by Jason Donovan - picks up its run in Cheltenham on June 23, and is aiming for a West End return.  Book for Hairspray   and Priscilla  The verdant north London venue, which managed a   of Jesus Christ Superstar last summer, is back with a full season. First up, Kimberley Sykes directs Shakespeare’s tragedy of star-crossed lovers (June 26-July 24), and then Timothy Sheader helms Rodgers and Hammerstein’s iconic musical, with choreography from Drew McOnie (July 30-September 18). There’s also Derek Bond’s interactive Dragons and Mythical Beasts for youngsters (August 10-September 5). The stage musical version of the DreamWorks animated movie features fresh songs from Oscar winner Stephen Schwartz, along with his enduring anthem When You Believe. This epic production charts Moses’ journey to free the Israelites in Ancient Egypt, while battling his adopted brother Ramses, the Pharaoh.  This family-favourite musical from Andrew Lloyd Webber and Tim Rice was revived in 2019, and - though delayed a year - Laurence Connor’s lively, contemporary production now gets a well-deserved encore run. Jac Yarrow reprises his performance in the lead role of Joseph, and Jason Donovan also returns as the Elvis-styled Pharaoh.  Previously due to run in 2020, this Nottingham Playhouse/Leeds Playhouse co-production of Pam Gems’ drama tells the extraordinary story of the world-renowned chanteuse, who went from singing on the streets to hits like La Vie en Rose and Je Ne Regrette Rien. Jenna Russell stars as Piaf, and the theatre will be transformed into a Parisian bar with cabaret-style seating. Rodgers and Hammerstein’s stirring musical is set on an archipelago in 1943, and features romance, espionage and racial prejudice - plus great songs like I’m Gonna Wash That Man Right Outa My Hair, Some Enchanted Evening and There Is Nothing Like a Dame. Daniel Evans directs, and tickets are on general sale soon. The faithful stage musical version of the Julia Roberts/Richard Gere romcom is back in the West End, though transferring from the Piccadilly to the Savoy Theatre. The cast features Aimie Atkinson, Danny Mac and Rachel Wooding, with music from Bryan Adams and Jim Vallance. The raucous religious satire from South Park’s Matt Stone and Trey Parker, and Frozen’s  , is still one of the most provocative shows in the West End. It follows two mismatched Mormon missionaries who travel to Uganda in hopes of preaching to the inhabitants of a remote village, only to come up against a local warlord. The Secret Cinema organisation has   recently, first for its sizable chunk of the Culture Recovery Fund, and then again for commandeering a local park. Will its riff on the beloved Patrick Swayze/Jennifer Grey film be enough to silence detractors? You can carry your watermelon to the event this summer and find out. Andrew Lloyd Webber has led the charge on getting theatres back in action, and he’s putting his money where his mouth is with this new musical take on the classic fairy tale, starring Carrie Hope Fletcher. It promises to be a spikier version, thanks to a book from  ’s Emerald Fennell, and the Lord has already teased audiences by releasing some of the songs. The stage adaptation of David Walliams' hit children's book should prove a family favourite this summer.  It tells the story of Joe Spud, the richest boy in the country, who has everything money can buy, except a friend. The Birmingham Stage Company production comes to the West End following a UK tour. The continuation of JK Rowling’s book series is a theatrical triumph, using astonishing illusions, movement, lighting and props to conjure up her magical world. But this two-part production, directed by John Tiffany and scripted by Jack Thorne, pays just as much attention to characters and their relationships, giving audiences an engrossing - and moving - story. Lloyd Webber is also responsible for the return of the Phantom, along with a refurbished theatre and revamped production. Killian Donnelly plays the (aptly) masked man who dwells beneath the Paris Opera House and mentors the beautiful soprano Christine in secret, seducing her with his “music of the night”. Will & Grace star Megan Mullally makes her West End debut opposite Robert Lindsay in this classic Cole Porter/P. G. Wodehouse musical, which takes place on board a luxury ocean liner. Featuring romance, comic hijinks, dancing sailors and great standards like It’s De-Lovely, You’re the Top and I Get a Kick Out of You, it’s gold-plated escapism. The popular jukebox musical, which follows the turbulent journey of Frankie Valli and the Four Seasons - from hit songs to band infighting and troubles with the mob - is back in the West End. The musical will open the revamped Trafalgar Theatre, which has been returned to its original heritage design with just one, larger auditorium. Julie Taymor’s inspired, child-friendly stage version of the Disney animated film returns. This creative production uses epic puppetry and special effects to evoke the African Pridelands. Add in catchy Elton John and Tim Rice songs like Circle of Life, Hakuna Matata and Can You Feel the Love Tonight, and it’s one parents can enjoy too. This glorious theatrical adaptation of the MGM Golden Age movie is back, along with former Royal Ballet principal Adam Cooper in the Gene Kelly role. A loving spoof of 1920s Hollywood being rocked by the “talkies”, it’s packed with great numbers - including that title song, accompanied by 14,000 litres of water splashed on stage every night. The Hope Mill was only able to stage five performances of Rent last autumn before lockdown struck, although the production was  . But a full theatrical run is very welcome, giving disappointed audiences another chance to see Jonathan Larson's beloved musical live and in person. Luke Shepperd directs. The stage version of the iconic sci-fi adventure movie – which sees cool 80s teenager Marty McFly transported back to 1955 via Doc Brown's time-travelling DeLorean, where he must ensure his parents fall in love – opened in Manchester in March 2020, and now gets its belated West End transfer. Expect futuristic special effects and rock 'n' roll. The long-awaited UK premiere of the Disney stage extravaganza will finally arrive in August, so get ready to build a snowman and “Let It Go”. Samantha Barks and Stephanie McKeon star as Princesses Elsa and Anna respectively. Existing ticket-holders will receive a new booking date, and tickets go back on general sale on April 15. One of the   announced for 2021 is this adaptation of Helen Forrester’s autobiography, about moving to Liverpool in the 1930s after her father went bankrupt and having to fight for her independence. All being well, it will begin at the Lowther Pavilion in Lytham St Annes, Lancashire, in September and then play at 18 theatres in different towns and cities. It might seem like an impossible tale to adapt for stage, but the Crucible Theatre in Sheffield used ingenious theatrical tricks and state-of-the-art visuals to conjure a boy trapped in a lifeboat with a Royal Bengal tiger. Now, this dramatisation of Yann Martel’s Man Booker Prize-winning novel comes to the West End. Shakespeare meets 90s pop hits in this irresistible show, which allows Juliet to escape her tragic fate and embark on a new adventure instead. The score takes its songs from the stupendous back catalogue of songwriter Max Martin, who created hits for the likes of Britney Spears, the Backstreet Boys, Taylor Swift and Ariana Grande. One of the great losses of the 2020 theatre programme was the thrilling prospect of Cush Jumbo playing Hamlet. Happily, the London venue has announced that the show is back on for this autumn, with the busy actress – who played Mark Anthony in the Donmar's all-female Julius Caesar – directed by her long-time collaborator Greg Hersov. This world premiere tells the story of the Jamaican superstar, honouring not just his enduring songs - like No Woman, No Cry, I Shot the Sheriff, and One Love - but also his social and political advocacy. Lee Hall has written the book, Clint Dyer directs, and Arinzé Kene plays Bob Marley. The National Theatre’s sold-out stage adaptation of Neil Gaiman’s novel gets a West End encore. This spellbinding tale features a man returning to his home town for a funeral, which sparks memories of an invasive supernatural being and the magical family who helped him to battle it. The imaginative production features skilful puppetry and illusions.  Beverley Knight stars as pioneering music manager Faye Treadwell, who led The Drifters to global fame - while battling prejudice within the industry. This new musical will feature numerous hits, such as Kissin’ in the Back Row of the Movies, and also give long-overdue attention to a legendary figure."
politics,,,,,"In the months it took for schools’ #MeToo moment to go from underground rumble to full explosion, you may have noticed that the word “elite” became not just a slur but a confirmation of guilt in and of itself. It’s been there at the centre of every headline, the narrative both explicit and implicit being that the culture of sexual abuse we’ve allowed to fester for decades within British schools is one born of privilege. Over the past few weeks hardly a day seems to have passed without another pupil from an “elite” private school such as St Paul’s, Eton, Latymer, Westminster, Highgate, Dulwich College and King’s College, Wimbledon  . The names of famous male alumni have always loomed large in these accounts, alongside words like “entitled,” “obnoxious”, “privileged” and “untouchable” – with nobody publicly asking the question every parent was privately asking themselves: “Are we really supposed to believe that this toxic culture is confined to the private sector?” Anything that fits too neatly into the accepted narrative du jour should be questioned. Yet only now – 10 months after   – are we starting to acknowledge how widespread this culture is. There has been a significant recent increase in the number of state schools being mentioned on the site, says Sara, who admits to having found the narrowing down of such a vital and long-overdue conversation “disappointing”. And while Scotland Yard’s lead on rape and sexual offences,   another of the country’s most senior police officers, Chief Constable Simon Bailey, took this a step further yesterday when he said: “This goes right across the whole of the education section… and I think it is the next big national child sexual abuse scandal.” Sara’s site may have been called Everyone’s Invited but ironically the movement it has spawned seems to have remained exclusive – until now. As with the first #MeToo, I find this concerning on a number of levels. Firstly, there was our rush to tarnish every privileged white male with the same brush – not that anyone’s going to feel much sympathy for them. Far more important, however, is that while we were revelling in that condemnation in our usual class-obsessed British way, we were turning a blind eye to the state sector, and the far-reaching nature of a culture where, as Bailey says, “young men are viewing pornography, are seeing the sexualisation of women and as a result of that healthy relationships are not truly understood”. Does privilege and entitlement have a part to play? Of course. Harvey Weinstein would not have behaved with the flagrancy and impunity in which he did without being bolstered by those things. But just as some of the first actresses to speak up in 2017 felt able to do so because of the confidence their positions gave them, “a privately-educated schoolgirl will probably find it easier to speak out about any harassment she’s being subjected to than someone without similar resources or that in-built support network”, says one state-school educated friend. In the two times  , she was at pains to point out that however helpful the “very high-profile” women were in calling out their aggressors, “the danger is that it can sometimes obscure the not so high-profile”. Her movement would ultimately only be successful, she explained, if the average woman felt just as able to call out her abusive boss as a Hollywood actress. Sara echoed those thoughts on Sunday when she admitted to concerns that a handful of private schools seemed to be taking a disproportionate amount of the blame for a culture that was pervasive in both the private and state sector. “This is a universal problem,” she pointed out, “it’s a global issue.” By restricting our focus to one slice of society, “it risks making these cases seem like they’re rare or anomalies, or that these patterns of abuse can only happen in certain places. But no, they happen everywhere, all the time. And they can happen to anyone.” I’m not the biggest fan of social media, but in that one respect, its democratic nature could prove helpful. It won’t be enough, however. Because now that everyone really has been invited to speak out in this conversation, any overhaul of private school inspections, such as the one currently being touted, should of course be opened up to all British schools. “Sexual violence doesn’t discriminate,” Burke told me. Neither should we."

The best classical CDs and DVDs of 2021 so far, from Simon Rattle to Clare Hammond

In this regularly updated guide, our critic recommends the best classical and opera releases of the year – and suggests a few to avoid

","Intimacy and grandeur seem the least likely bedfellows, but it’s precisely that unlikely conjunction that gives Elgar’s music its unique flavour. So often in his music a huge public utterance girded with brass and military rhythms seems to melt away before our very ears, and we suddenly find ourselves in a twilight landscape of regret and nostalgia. In no work is that special quality more hauntingly evident than the Violin Concerto. Elgar composed it in 1910 in response to a request from the American virtuoso Fritz Kreisler, who was determined to have a concerto from the man he said was the greatest living composer. Elgar responded with a concerto on the same heroic scale as Brahms’s, full of vaunting virtuoso passages where the violinist has to dominate the orchestra. But unlike Brahms’s it has a cadenza which instead of being a moment of heroic display is a tender rumination on previously heard ideas, accompanied by thrumming plucked chords which – in this performance at least – sound like the quiet rustling of nature on a summer afternoon. French violinist Renaud Capuçon turns out to be an ideal soloist for this very English work. He catches the music’s quicksilver spirit, the way at one moment it’s gathering pace and intensity towards a high point, the next hesitating in small, shy phrases, or pulling back by degrees towards a moment of radiant calm, like a patch of sunlight in a forest. Rattle and the London Symphony Orchestra are every bit as sensitive and labile, and the subtle weave of Elgar’s orchestration takes on a lovely glow. If I don’t place it right at the top of available recordings of the concerto that’s because it feels a touch too spacious and meditative, missing that eager, impetuous quality that the recent recording by James Ehnes and the Philharmonia Orchestra catches so well. About the recording of the sonata in which Capuçon is partnered by pianist Stephen Hough I have no such reservations. The dialogue between pianist and violin is beautifully clear, and the balance between tender soliloquy and grandiloquence feels exactly right. Some pianists charm and caress you with subtle shadings and half-tones, some seize you by the scruff with steely-fingered decisiveness. Clare Hammond is definitely one of the latter sort. Her latest album, an exploration of the art of variation – i.e. ringing ever-more elaborate changes on a pattern or melody announced at the beginning – certainly shows off that aspect of her talent. It avoids the familiar masters of the genre like Beethoven and Schumann, focusing instead on 20th and 21st-century pieces. Among them is the Variations by Aaron Copland, a piece that will instantly disabuse anyone of the idea that Copland was just a purveyor of cheerful, all-American folksiness. Its pitiless, hard-edged abstraction made it a favourite of Leonard Bernstein, who took a mischievous delight in emptying the room at swanky Manhattan parties by playing it at full volume. Hammond makes it seem as huge and steely as the Brooklyn Bridge, but without resorting to sheer force. She balances the sonorities carefully, so we can hear the original idea gleaming through all the dissonant barbed-wire Copland erects around it.  The same combination of power and dramatic sweep with careful attention to detail can be heard in the other pieces. In the craggy, immense Chaconne by Russian composer Sofia Gubaidulina she allows no respite from the drama, which builds in waves of rising and falling tension to the final dénoument. She softens the sinews of Hindemith’s severe 1936 Variations with subtle tempo variations, and brings a nice sense of cat-like stealth to Birtwistle’s Variations on the Golden Mountain. Not everything is hard and monumental. John Adams’s I Still Play has a diffident waltz-like charm. And the Variations on a Polish Theme by Karol Szymanowski is as far from Copland as you could imagine. The piece is in his most impressionist, sensuous vein, and Hammond responds with a delicate but still firmly shaped touch, and a deft use of pedal that reveals the bones under all the luxurious flesh. It may not be a masterpiece but Hammond keeps us enthralled to the last bar. Der Freischütz (“The Freeshooter”) was one of the smash operatic hits of the 19th century. Carl Maria von Weber’s dark tale of a hunter who makes with a pact with the devil so he can win a shooting competition and win the head forester’s daughter was the spark that lit the German Romantic revolution in opera. Wagner was electrified by it, and said that without Der Freischütz he would never have become a composer. By the end of the 19th century the opera’s naïve supernatural trappings, such as the chorus of gibbering spirits gathered in a forest clearing at midnight, were starting to seem creaky. In the early 21st century there are other reasons to be embarrassed by Der Freischütz, especially the heartily patriarchal culture of back-slapping hunters and docile womenfolk. But never fear. This combined CD/DVD offers a French production from 2019 which couldn’t possibly embarrass anyone. The name is a giveaway: “The Freischütz Project”. It suggests this opera can’t simply be presented, it must be given a makeover to make it palatable to modern tastes. Some aspects of the makeover are actually welcome. The Insula Orchestra uses “period” instruments appropriate to the early 19th century, so the biting horns and twilight gloom of Weber’s orchestration seem unusually vivid. The performances, especially Johanni van Oostrum as the faithful Agathe are strong. Other aspects of the makeover are simply annoying. Both the CD and the DVD offer only highlights of the opera, so neither gives a complete narrative. The charming bridal chorus sung by Agathe’s bridesmaids which is the opera’s most famous number is actually omitted, presumably because it was felt to be reprehensibly patriarchal. The production takes place on an austere bare stage, without even a hint of the opera’s German-forest setting – apart from the inevitable use of back-projection to give us literal forest-scenes, which as always with back-projections absolutely fails to stimulate the imagination. If you really want to feel the thrill of Weber’s opera, put on the CD of the classic recording conducted by Erich Kleiber in 1955, sit back and close your eyes. It’s the only “Freischütz Project” you’ll ever need. The charmingly fresh-faced young Z.E.N. piano trio is made up of an American violinist, a Chinese pianist and an Armenian cellist, who came together in 2015 when they were members of BBC Radio 3’s New Generation Artist scheme. Their name is nothing to do with Buddhism, it’s simply a neat acronym of the first letters of their first names, and there’s nothing meditative about their new CD, a collection of four Russian pieces centred around Shostakovich’s great E minor Trio of 1944. It’s hard to overstate the tragic depth of this piece, which was inspired by the early death of Shostakovich’s great friend the musicologist and polymath Ivan Sollertinsky but was also overshadowed by the war. In the Finale there’s a tune of unmistakeably Jewish character which is hammered out in a frenzy, a musical image of despair which some say was inspired by the revelation that SS guards made Jewish prisoners dance next to their own graves. The combination of bleak ghostly lament and savage parody leads many trios to exaggerate the extremes, but that isn’t The Z.E.N. Trio’s way. They prefer a more traditionally musical approach, allowing space for those subtle variations in tempo and expressive mouldings of phrases which a performance pitched at a constant scream of maximum intensity can’t manage. On the whole tempos are faster than average, which makes the narrative of the Finale where all the previous movements pass by like a dream easier to grasp. Their performance is no less moving than more overtly tragic performances, and its only drawback is that here and there the pianist Zhang Zuo seems underpowered. Alongside Shostakovich's trio are two pieces, both beautifully played, which show a very different side of Soviet music. Arno Babadjanian’s piano trio of 1952 harks back to turn-of-the-century Russian romanticism, while the famous Sabre Dance from another Armenian composer, Aram Khachturian, is in the picturesque exotic vein of Soviet ballet. Next to these Rachmaninov’s gorgeously melancholic Vocalise of 1915, which rounds off the disc, doesn’t seem at all out of place. It’s an impressive release for a Trio which will surely go far. Some   of the podium can make do with directing just one of the world’s great orchestras. That’s not enough for the electrifying Latvian conductor Andris Nelsons. He’s chief conductor of the Boston Symphony Orchestras and Leipzig Gewandhaus orchestras, and is now busy recording all fifteen symphonies of Shostakovich with the first, and all nine of Bruckner’s with the second. One hardly dares imagine the Air Miles he’s clocked up in the process. Some have made unflattering comparisons between the white-hot energy of the Shostakovich recordings and a certain over-relaxed quality of the Bruckner cycle. That’s certainly not my impression. The Bruckner recordings are among the best around, and this new one, a double-CD set of an early and late symphony along with the Prelude to Wagner's Meistersinger, is stunning. Bruckner’s early Second Symphony has all the hall-marks of the mature composer – lilting Viennese lyricism, spacious hymn-like melodies, and huge craggy pile-ups of brass fanfares and wheeling violin patterns suggestive of vast spaces. But the vision isn’t yet quite in focus. The patterns are often too four-square, and the big sections are set off so emphatically from each other that the music’s flow can easily become clogged. Not in this performance, where Nelsons seizes on every opportunity to relax the tempo or push it forward, which softens the edges of those granite-like blocks. And because the playing is so delicately shaded Bruckner’s rich rhythmic tangles in the second movement, where all the string parts move at a different speed, register with maximum clarity. In the much better-known and greater Eighth Symphony this rhythmic flexibility allows Nelsons to take some risks. “Solemnly, not dragging” is how Bruckner marks the second movement, and though Nelsons’s tempo is immensely slow the music never loses momentum. “Solemnly, not fast” is the marking in the Finale, but Nelsons actually takes it at a tremendous urgent pace, and by cleverly maintaining the urgency until the end – while making room for lovely lyrical digressions – he makes more sense of this huge puzzling movement than many performances I’ve heard. Wagner’s Meistersinger Prelude, like everything else on the disc, has a spacious glowing sound, with much fine-grained detail. In every way this recording is a winner. Aristocrat or bumpkin? Joseph Haydn seems to be both at once, which is a large part of his appeal. His music effortlessly straddles the class divide, just as it straddles any number of other opposites: high and low, serious and comic, transcendent and everyday. However this new recording of his radiant, wise and often mysterious set of six quartets Op 76 leans heavily towards the aristocratic. The excellent liner notes by Richard Wigmore talk constantly about the “rustic energy” of these pieces, particularly the dance movements which on the page can seem almost uncouth. But never on these recordings. Those minuets sidle into being with insinuating gracefulness, as if we’re in an aristocratic ballroom. It’s the same story in the spacious opening movements, the rapt hymn-like slow movements, and the helter-skelter finales. Everything sounds super-refined, partly because the players perform on 18th-century instruments, which make a lighter, more dancing sound. But this quartet sounds very different to other so-called “period quartets”. They tend to emphasise Haydn’s nervous energy and broad-brush humour. The London Haydn Quartet give those balanced phrases and sudden pauses a very different, tenderly expressive quality.   To achieve this the players make a much smoother sound. Not once do you hear the cheerful “bouncing bow” effect, which other period-instrument quartets use all the time. The players sometimes make a surprisingly romantic expressive droop or slide between notes, but it’s applied so fleetingly I wondered whether I was imagining it, and had to rewind the recording and re-listen just to be sure. It’s the same with vibrato, that expressive trembling quality which some period-instrument quartets banish altogether. On this recording it’s certainly there, but so subtly done I often couldn’t tell whether I was hearing vibrato or not. And in almost every bar the players pull the tempo back, or push it forward, or make the tiniest hesitation to emphasise an emphatic chord. Some listeners may miss the foot-stamping, peasant aspect of Haydn, and I did myself – for a while. But the mysterious, intimate side of these pieces burned more brightly, which more than made up for the loss. For most of the 172 years since his death, the great master of Italian early romantic opera Gaetano Donizetti was known only for a handful of masterpieces. Most of his 65 operas seemed condemned to permanent oblivion. But in recent decades many of these have been rescued, and some have turned out to be near masterpieces, almost on a par with the ones we know and love such as L’Elisir d’Amore and Lucia di Lammermoor. It’s fair to say Pietro il Grande (“Peter the Great”), a comic opera unveiled in Venice in 1820 when the composer was only 23, is not one of them. But as this DVD of the 2019 Donizetti Festival production reveals, it’s not negligible either. The master of lusciously ornate vocal melody we know from the mature operas is already fully formed, though the young Donizetti hadn’t yet found his wonderfully delicate touch as an orchestrator (and the rough-edged orchestral playing doesn’t show it off to best advantage).  But the overall Rossini-pastiche style of the opera is brilliantly done, and includes one “patter” duet that will leave you humming the tune for days. The story is every bit as silly as you’d expect. The Tsar and his wife are travelling incognito in search of his wife’s lost brother, and they pitch up in a village where a young carpenter is in love with a local belle who is pursued by a venal money-lender. Of course the carpenter turns out to be the long-lost brother, and before the inevitable happy ending there are plenty of comic imbroglios. The directing team from Ondadurto Teatro decided that a Russian-Suprematist-style production would be just the ticket for an opera set in Tsarist times, because after all the Tsar was very forward-looking. It’s one of those mad ideas that only an opera director would think of, and the costumes, which make everyone look like animated Suprematist paintings with a topping of 19th-century pomp, are eye-wateringly bad. But at least their riotous colourfulness is amusing, and the performances are equally over-the-top. Roberto de Candia as the Tsar is a weak link, but the light soprano of Nina Solodovnikova as the belle Annetta is charming. Marco Filippo Romano as the corrupt and lascivious magistrate is a treat, and there are nice cameos from Tommaso Barea as the money-lender and Stefano Gentili as the Notary. The other new Donizetti release is on an altogether different level. Premiered nine years after Pietro il Grande, Il Paria (“The Pariah”) is a tragedy about the horrors of racial and religious bigotry set in ancient India. A priestess of Brahma is in love with a military hero, who unfortunately turns out to be the son of a Pariah.  The truth is revealed at the end, and priestess, hero and the outcast father all die together, at the hand of the enraged Brahmin priests – but not before the Pariah prophesises that their laws “will be destroyed by the people of a later age”, a remarkably modern-sounding sentiment. By now Donizetti is leaving the Rossinian tradition behind and moving towards the more dramatic, continuous style of Verdi. The clash between the iron laws of duty and romantic ardour is a very Verdian theme, and there are some astonishing anticipations of Verdi’s dramatic use of harmony and colourful orchestration. So it’s a superior piece, but the care and attention to detail lavished on the recording lifts it still higher. Opera Rara is dedicated to rescuing little-known romantic operas from oblivion, and for this recording they’ve actually gone to the trouble of commissioning a new error-free edition of the music from leading Italian opera scholars. The soloists have been chosen with equal care. Donizetti wrote one of his most perilously high and athletic tenor parts for the hero Idamore, and you have to marvel at the way René Barbera tackles this high-wire act. Marko Mimica is superb as the unflinchingly vicious high priest Akebare, and Misha Kiria as Idamore’s father Zarete seems at first to be equally iron and unbending, though eventually he’s touched with a redeeming humanity. Soaring over them all, literally and metaphorically, is the tenderly flexible soprano of Albina Shagimuratova. She melts the heart of the listener as the high priestess Neala, but not alas the fiercely patriarchal culture around her. Helping the vocal soloists to shine is the intelligent and tautly disciplined playing from the Britten Sinfonia under Mark Elder, and the ardent singing of the Opera Rara Chorus. In all it’s a marvel; let’s hope it encourages an enterprising opera company to bring the piece to the stage. Musical celebrations at Versailles in the reign of Louis XIV were normally on a grand scale, as befitted the most powerful monarch in Europe. But by the end of his life Louis was getting weary of the pompous ceremonial which surrounded every aspect of his life. Le Grand Coucher – the Grand Going to Bed – was giving way to the Petit Coucher, a less onerously formal affair. Thanks to a particularly assiduous court musician named Philidor, the archives at Versailles contain a treasury of small-scale, intimate music which he copied out for these bed-time musical entertainments. Many of them are arrangements of pieces which began life on a much bigger scale somewhere else, as a ballet or dramatic scene. Using this archive, French lutenist Thibaut Roussel has gathered together a group of ten excellent young players and two singers to create an imaginary Petit Coucher on an evening in early 1713. To appreciate the seductive flavour of this disc it’s probably best until wait until bed-time, and have a hot toddy to hand. That will help you savour the strange, melancholy atmosphere of this music, designed for rooms with heavy curtains and tapestries where the sun rarely penetrates. The procession of grave pieces for the deep bass lute, beautifully played by Roussel, are interwoven with equally grave Plaintes (laments) or Preludes for a bigger but still intimate group of flutes, violin, bass viols and harpsichord. Every now and then there’s a welcome injection of energy from a suite of dances, but it doesn’t last. Mingled in with the instrumental pieces are four vocal numbers, including an amorous duet for Cleopatra and Mark Anthony sung with a perfect sense of style by mezzo-soprano Danaé Monnié and baritone Marc Mauillon (though Monnié’s vocal sound is much more tender and winning). Along with the CD there’s a DVD of the group performing in the beautiful Hall of Mirrors at Versailles, which is a treat in itself. It can’t be denied there’s a certain sameness of mood, but the mood is so extraordinary and the sounds so delicious you won’t mind. “Heavenly length” is a description often applied to Schubert’s generous musical forms, which roam through distant harmonies with leisurely ease as if the music has all the time in the world. It’s a phrase that’s apt for the two chamber pieces on a new recording released by Naxos, especially the late Piano Trio, which despite its slender forces is a big beast: the final movement is over 20 minutes long. In some performances that luxurious length, combined with the assertive, thick piano texture, can weigh heavy on the ear. That never happens in these new recordings, partly because the players perform on old instruments appropriate to the period. The Arpeggione sonata was originally written for a bowed guitar, a newly-invented instrument which enjoyed a brief vogue in Schubert’s Vienna and was later dubbed ""arpeggione"".  We normally hear it on the cello, but here Alexander Rudin performs it on an arpeggione, which is a revelation. It has a winningly transparent sound, and Schubert’s frequent ascents to the high register which can sound strenuous on a cello seem easy and natural on this instrument. Rudin’s accompanist Aapo Häkkinen plays on an early 19 -century piano that’s exactly right for the music. The delightful silvery slenderness of the fortepiano’s sound means the balance problems that often afflict this piece and the Trio simply melt away. However just as you shouldn’t blame the tools when a workman does a bad job, you shouldn’t praise them either when things turn out superbly. Aapo Häkkinen is simply a wonderful musician, who would surely sound great on a pub honky-tonk piano. He has a charming way of softening the edges of Schubert’s score with an almost improvisatory freedom, often rolling chords that most pianists play ""straight"". Alexander Rudin and violinist Erich Höbart make a sound that’s robust without ever being heavy, and all three together infuse the music with a subtle rhythmic freedom, so Schubert’s frequent repetitions never sound exactly the same. “Heavenly length,” indeed."

Red Nose Day for Comic Relief 2021, review: James Bond and Catherine Tate's Nan shine on hit-and-miss night
","
Daniel Craig joined David Tennant, Lenny Henry and Dawn French for the BBC's annual fundraiser. Here are the best and worst bits
",Michael Hogan,"
20 March 2021 • 10:26am
","The biennial red-nosed entertainment extravaganza was back, now in its 36th year. Funds were raised for worthy causes with a night of BBC programming, filled with comedy sketches, musical performances, live studio surprises and inspiringly weepy stories. Last year, its sister fundraising push   raised £40.5 million. The previous   fundraiser in 2019 reached a total of £63 million by the end of the evening. Could this telethon exceed those totals? It appeared likely. Would anyone hop into a bath of baked beans like ye olde charidee days? It appeared unlikely. Spoilsports. Here are all the best bits, worst bits and talking points from Comic Relief 2021. The name’s Nan… Catherine Tate’s Nan. The night’s standout sketch saw 007 meet 0075. Tate’s potty-mouthed pensioner was cleaning at MI6 HQ and took an unexpected call from Daniel Craig’s dapper spy while cleaning M's office. She poked fun at Bond for being “a confirmed bachelor” who was “well-turned out, very particular” and partial to sipping cocktails from small glasses. She tutted about the BBC licence fee (“150 sovs, what a nerve”). She took the globe-trotting secret agent to task over his hefty carbon footprint.  “Do yourself a favour,” Nan told him. “Wind your money-wasting-earth-burning-Speedo-wearing-leading-lady-killing-sexiest-man-alive-no-one-believes-you’re-53-makes-us-all-look-bad neck in.”  There was only really one reply. With relish, Bond signed off with: “What a f***ing liberty."" Ian Fleming would surely approve. Dawn French’s much-loved comedy cleric Reverend Geraldine Granger  during last year’s “Zoom sermon” specials, which caused something of an ecclesiastical culture war kerfuffle.  Thankfully there was less controversy-baiting here as she appeared alongside real-life vicar Kate Bottley for a sort-of-musical sketch to open the show. The two women of the cloth donned sequin-spangled vestments to enthusiastically lip sync to Juice by Lizzo.  There were Toblerone props. There were synchronised dance moves. There was some trademark Dawn French face-pulling. It felt a little throwaway (was Richard Curtis too busy raising money to write a proper script?) but jolly enough. “Bless ye for watching,” as they concluded. Appearing on British TV for the first time in five years, Canadian pop brat Justin Bieber treated the nation’s “Beliebers” to an exclusive performance of his new single Hold On. All very well, but he might've had a wash, removed his baseball cap and smartened up a bit. What do you mean, I sound old? Other musical performances came from Gabrielle (jazzy) and the cast of Back to the Future: The Musical (decent script, cheesy tunes). “‘Where we’re going, which is into lockdown, we don’t need roads.” Comic Matt Lucas impersonated Take That’s Gary Barlow to croon a duet with the real thing.  Another segment found five comedy types trying their hand at opera. Mentored by soprano Charlotte Church, they performed classic Turandot aria Nessun Dorma live in the studio after a mere 24 hours rehearsal. Caroline Quentin and Jayde Adams were especially strong. Fireworks went off. Memories of Italia ’90 flooded back. Yet all the above were ultimately upstaged by bespectacled twins from Fife. A powerful montage of key workers and pandemic pensioners (including the late Captain Sir Tom Moore) was soundtracked by a lighters-in-the-air live rendition of The Proclaimers’ ballad Sunshine On Leith. The VT ended on a note of hope with vaccine jabs and loved ones reunited. When it cut back to presenter David Tennant, his voice cracked with emotion. I doubt he was alone.  One of the more amusing sketches was a spoof trailer for “the biggest blockbuster never made” - a disaster film about last year, populated by our lockdown superheroes. “Let's hope there won’t be a sequel,” went the tagline.  The starry cast included Russell Brand as body coach Joe Wicks, Ainsley Harriott as child-feeding footballer Marcus Rashford, Anna Friel as the first woman to cut her own hair, Keira Knightley and Carey Mulligan as mothers who’d had enough of home-schooling, and Sanjeev Bhaskar as Professor Chris Whitty’s “next slide please” guy “Barry from EastEnders” appeared as the man who invented Zoom. “I’m ready for my vaccine now, Mr DeMille,” purred the mighty Joan Collins.  All very well-observed - apart from the Doctor Who-meets-Casualty bit, where they seemed to think that Bake Off aired on Thursdays. Hey, I suppose a Timelord can watch it whichever night she chooses.  Michael Sheen and David Tennant's luvvies-in-lockdown comedy was one of the few successes of Covid-19 programming. Fresh from its second series, the pair reunited (virtually, of course) for a special historical skit, set during a whole different plague in 1592. Tennant played William Shakespeare, Sheen was Christopher Marlowe. Both wore ruffs, cloaks and tights. The pair bickered wittily over whether people wanted social realism from their playwright-poets or “escapism, maybe something with a donkey.” That is, until guest star Lenny Henry gatecrashed the call to remind them they were actors, not writers. It was as tightly written, tongue-in-cheek and whiskery as we’ve come to expect. “I’ve got an alphabet grenade. If that goes off, it could spell disaster.”  One of the night’s daftest yet most irresistibly funny skits was by one of its least starry names: stand-up comic Tim “brother of Jeremy Vine”.  Dispatched to a kiosk at RAF Northolt, “the lieutenant of laughter in a box” told quickfire jokes to servicemen and women. By my count, Vine cracked 28 gags in two minutes.  It was splendidly silly, old-school fun which sweetly reduced the military heroes to giggles. “I went to the doctor and he told me: ‘You’ve got hypochondria.’ I said: ‘Not that as well.’” Millennials must have been throwing their avocado lattés into the air with delight during a mash-up between the stars of BBC Three’s biggest hits, Normal People and Fleabag. Filmed under Covid restrictions in a London church, a seven-minute skit saw the unnamed Hot Priest from Fleabag (Andrew Scott) get two unexpected visitors in his confessional booth: Normal People’s tongue-tied young lovers Connell (Paul Mescal) and Marianne (Daisy Edgar-Jones).  They poked fun at themselves in a playful but oddly poignant exchange which involved Connell’s silver chain necklace and a Boyzone-meets-Tracy Chapman croon-along which showcased the trio’s unexpectedly gorgeous singing voices.  Admittedly, this wasn’t an original skit. It first aired on Ireland’s RTE Does Comic Relief last summer. Yet this meeting of two yoof TV phenomena was still a huge treat. At least for the few who hadn’t already enjoyed it on YouTube over the past nine months.  The main three-hour show was helmed by a socially distanced quintet. The hosting tagteam comprised Sir Lenny Henry (elder statesmanlike), Davina McCall (giggly), Paddy McGuinness (cheeky), Alesha Dixon (kept fluffing her lines) and David Tennant (who appeared to have time-travelled from a Seventies menswear catalogue). Tennant was comfortably the pick of the bunch. He switched gears deftly between witticisms and charitable sincerity. He was palpably proud to be there, becoming choked up by the public’s pluck and generosity of spirit. Sure, he’s a luvvie but he’s a lovely one.  At 10pm, the action switched to BBC Two for a Comic Relief-themed edition of live music stalwart Later With Jools Holland. It saw Lenny Henry popping up again - there truly was no escape from the Dudley-born funnyman - to pick his favourite musical moments from Comic Relief and Later history.  It proved an infectious trawl through the archives. His eclectic selection took in everything from Tom Jones to Dizzee Rascal, Supergrass to the Spice Girls, George Clinton to Kate Bush. Sir Lenworth reminisced about his parents’ record collection, paid fond tribute to the late Amy Winehouse, and raved passionately about funk, rap and reggae. He even kept Holland’s boogie-woogie piano-playing to a minimum, which was nice. We probably didn’t need yet another attempt at Zoom-based comedy. Nor reminding of the soul-crushing inanity of virtual meetings. But the BBC, in their bountiful wisdom, still seem to think we do. Hence well-spoken funnyman Jack Whitehall hosted a VIP videocall to thank everyone who’d made a donation.  The cast was head-turningly high-calibre, with Hugh Grant, Olivia Colman, Anya Taylor-Joy, James Corden, Idris Elba, Emma Thompson and Coldplay’s Chris Martin all logging on. The dull, stilted script was less impressive.  Viewers were desperately praying for Handforth parish council heroine Jackie Weaver to take control. I’d happily give her the authority.  Rather randomly, the husky Welsh diva’s 1983 hit Total Eclipse of the Heart got back-to-back airings. It not only appeared in Jack Whitehall’s Zoom sketch but a parody version was promptly crooned live in the studio by lockdown viral sensations, the Marsh family from Faversham.  A running order bungle rather than deliberate ploy. La Tyler will welcome the royalties and exposure nonetheless. Turn around, bright eyes. And please give generously if you can."

Joanna Lumley on inequality in acting: ‘Women will always have to be beautiful’
","
The Ab Fab star on being made to strip off for roles, joining Coronation Street, and why she wants to be a benevolent dictator
",Marianka Swain,"

","Female performers will always be under more pressure to look good than their male counterparts, believes  . Reflecting on her career, she noted that women were constantly sexualised, and that even though that culture has shifted, we’re unlikely to ever have true equality. The Absolutely Fabulous actress commented on the industry while speaking to Libby Purves at last night’s Telegraph Subscriber event, A Night In With Joanna Lumley. “Women for a long, long time were the lovely ones, and you always had to look extremely beautiful if you were going to be an actress,” said Lumley. “If you’re a beauty queen, you understand that. But if you’re an actress, you’re playing a part. Why do you have to be beautiful?” In contrast, she noted, male performers “like Humphrey Bogart could have lined cheeks and furrowed brows. It’s always been unfair. And guess what: it’s always going to be unfair.  “I know people are always trying to reach for parity. I’ve a funny feeling it will never happen, because in the whole long time that human beings have been alive, women have always had to look good for men to like them, and men have always had to be ‘attractive’ for women to like them. ‘Attractive’ means they might have lots of money, or might be good at something, or might look as though they could provide. They didn’t have to be handsome necessarily.” Lumley also recalled being ordered to strip off for roles in the 1970s. “It was absolutely mandatory, and if you didn’t want to do it, they’d go ‘Are you an actress or not?’.” Since Lumley was coming from the modelling world, and hadn’t been to drama school, she felt she had to comply. But it wasn’t just her, she notes. “Everybody had to take their tops off. You just see it with Vanessa Redgrave, Glenda Jackson, Jacqueline Bisset… Everybody had to strip their tops off. That was completely par for the course.” She added: “I hated it. I’ve never met a single person who likes to get their clothes off. Or indeed people who like to do love scenes. Everybody was revolted by love scenes.” Lumley recounted another grim experience, while taking her announcement picture for playing Purdey in The New Avengers. “They put me in a flimsy, flimsy dress with flimsy high heels, and they said ‘We’d like you to stick a gun in your stocking top, Joanna’, and I said ‘But I’m wearing tights’.”  They refused to take her picture without stockings, so she had to borrow some from a stranger. “Everything was like that in those days,” she explained. “You just did it. I hate having to have done it. Which is why when I eventually was asked to do stage parts like Hedda Gabler and Madame Ranevskaya, it was sweet as a nut. I’m never asked to do those parts on television. I’m still either a bitch or glamorous.” The exception was Ab Fab, where she was allowed to play a grotesque alongside Jennifer Saunders. “The more ridiculous and revolting we looked, the more people loved them.” Lumley described Patsy as hunching over because “she’s had all her inside taken out and her bottom [was] gone. She hadn’t eaten since 1974.” Patsy’s hair evoked Ivanna Trump’s, she added, and her smirking laugh was based on Elvis. Lumley, who is married to conductor Stephen Barlow, and is a trustee of Grange Park Opera, also commented on how the emphasis on physical appearance has changed in the opera world.  “In the old days, the voice was everything, and people thought you should just go to the theatre, the opera house and be grateful for the sound,” she noted. “Then gradually it began to creep in that more and more directors, and maybe even the public, said ‘Hang on, if she’s playing this drop-dead gorgeous woman, maybe she should look a little bit better than that. Maybe she shouldn’t look like ten-ton Tessie.' I’ll probably be killed for even saying that.  “But the truth is maybe she   look a little bit more like the role. Because a lot of that overeating was part of it. It was a kind of myth that the way to have a beautiful voice was to be quite big and bosom-y and fat stomach-ed. That’s been disproved. Now you see the most gorgeous opera singers with ravishing voices looking great. And of course they’re much fitter and they’re much lither and they’re much more believable as actresses, as singing actresses, on stage.” In her own career, Lumley got an early acting break with a guest role on Coronation Street as a love interest for Ken Barlow. “I was written as just an interlude,” she explained. “His wife had just been killed by a hairdryer. The whole world was in shock: ‘What would handsome Ken do now?’. I was the schoolmaster's daughter. I shimmied into his life.” It was an exciting opportunity – and one she was eager to extend. But the producers were firm that it was just an eight-episode run. In fact, she was asked to reprise the role recently but wasn’t able to do it, so Stephanie Beacham joined the show instead. “I was jealous as hell of her,” admitted Lumley. But her great love is Shakespeare – which she’s never been asked to do professionally, she lamented. Her dream role is Rosalind in As You Like It. As for her other role as an activist, working with organisations like Kids for Kids in Dafur and the Gurkha Justice Campaign, might that tempt Lumley to go into politics fulltime? Certainly not. “I had a glimpse of it during the gurkha campaign. I had a look into the corridors of power, and it doesn’t appeal to me because it’s too slow. I don’t want it to go into some committee in a month’s time and then people say ‘We’ll look at it more closely.’ I can’t bear all that. I want it to be done now. So I wouldn’t mind being a benevolent dictator, but I don’t want to be in Parliament.”"

The saviour of Archewell? Why Harry and Meghan hired Promising Young Woman producer Ben Browning
","
The veteran Hollywood deal-maker will attempt to turn the Sussexes' vanity project into a real industry force
",Marianka Swain,"
24 March 2021 • 3:00pm
","Do Prince Harry and Meghan Markle have an Oscar in their sights? The latest hire for their Archewell media company is Ben Browning, an independent film producer whose work includes current   nominee  .  Announced Monday, Browning will be the head of content for Archewell Productions and Archewell Audio, guiding their partnerships with   and Spotify. The Sussexes signed a multi-year deal with the streamer in September 2020, and made another with   late last year. According to Forbes, a mutual contact in the entertainment industry recommended Browning, and multiple meetings followed, during which Harry and Meghan discussed their ambition to connect with a young, worldwide audience. That seems to be borne out by Browning’s statement this week, in which he said that was attracted by the couple’s vision for Archewell as “a global production company that will spotlight diverse voices and share uplifting stories.” The Archewell Netflix deal is for a variety of programming, including scripted and unscripted TV series, documentaries, feature films and children’s shows. Their Spotify deal is for them to both produce and host podcasts that uplift and entertain, kicked off by their   in December. So, what direction might Browning take Archewell in - and does this hint at the kind of output we can expect from Harry and Meghan? Browning is a fellow Brit, although he grew up all over the world. He’s a veteran film and television producer, who has also run various companies and started his own. He co-founded Wayfare Entertainment in 2008, and joined FilmNation Entertainment in 2014, relocating from New York to Los Angeles in the process.  Browning’s early projects included the TV series Masters of Horror and Fear Itself. He also executive produced, with James Cameron, the schlocky underwater cave action-thriller Sanctum. It’s safe to assume that the Sussexes aren’t about to produce a sequel. Of more interest in Browning’s recent body of work. That’s characterised by sensitive, distinctive yet commercial indie projects - such as  , featuring a Pakistani-American stand-up comic whose parents want him to enter into an arranged marriage. That 2017 film drew acclaim on its Sundance premiere and went on to gross $56 million worldwide on a budget of just $5 million, as well as picking up an Oscar nomination for best original screenplay. He also worked on the cerebral sci-fi movie   and the stirring drama   - for which Brie Larson won a best actress Oscar. Additionally, Browning has executive produced successful screen adaptation of several novels, including Julian Barnes’  , starring Jim Broadbent, Charlotte Rampling, Harriet Walter and Michelle Dockery, and Ian McEwen’s  , starring Emma Thompson and Stanley Tucci. Browning then reunited with Thompson for  , in which she played a talk show host guided by Mindy Kaley’s new recruit. He also helped bring   to the screen: Armando Ianucci’s imaginative take on Charles Dickens, featuring bold creative choices and diverse casting. That experience should stand Browning in good stead when it comes to understanding Harry’s British point of view, and how to liaise between that and what works in Hollywood. Similarly, he knows how to turn out programming that is engrossing for viewers, as well as tackling important issues - whether it’s the intersection of the law and faith in The Children Act, Orthodox Judaism and sexuality in  , cultural differences in The Big Sick, colonial oppression in  , or systematic misogyny in Promising Young Woman. Browning is savvy about the streaming market too. Speaking to Deadline last January at Sundance, he commented on FilmNation’s record £13 million US sale of content to Amazon in 2019, led by movies like Late Night, saying that he felt it was an environment where the films would “get their best chance to reach an enthusiastic audience.” Browning also explained why they’d backed Promising Young Woman, with its “playful provocative script. It pulls no punches. It knows what it’s trying to say and I think that’s what audiences want from filmmakers.” He added that they’d pulled in plenty of well-known actors because it only took a day’s commitment, since they were shooting in LA. Speaking about his approach to projects, Browning said that FilmNation looked at “the financial profile of a film, the sales profile of a film, the distribution life of a film, and we’re trying to make responsible business decisions because most important to all of us is not that this company is thriving now but that it’s still thriving in 10 years.” However, he balanced that with backing singular ideas. “The real distinction point of any creative company is knowing where and when to take risks. The process here is that it starts with one person who works here thinking something is absolutely exceptional and not shutting up about it and conveying that to other people who work here.” Browning characterised their projects as “a little left of centre or a little representative of what is about to come in a cultural conversation.” That certainly sounds like it fits with the Sussexes’ new   and professed desire - as per the Archewell website - to “drive systemic cultural change across all communities, one act of compassion at a time”, and to use their production company in “harnessing the power of storytelling to embrace our shared humanity, amplifying diverse and inspiring content.” But beyond shared sensibilities about “inspiring content”, what’s perhaps most important here is Browning’s track record in actually delivering slick, professional projects that connect with audiences and make money. Given the Sussexes’ inexperience in this area (as demonstrated by their debut podcast) and the “demands” of  , having a partner with practical skills and knowledge is what might lift this from vaguely well-meant vanity project to real industry force. After all, there’s only so many times you can play the   card, or pal around with  . At some point, Harry and Meghan will need to let their work do the talking."

David Baldacci: 'My mother's tough upbringing in the remote mountains of Virginia inspired me'
","
David Baldacci reflects on the childhood road trip that inspired his celebrated book Wish You Well
",,"
29 March 2021 • 4:00pm
","It was the summer of 1976. I’d just turned 16 and was about to start my sophomore year when my dad Rudolph suggested one last road trip for the summer. My mum, Joyce, said she wanted to visit her old homestead in the remote  mountains on Ramsey’s Ridge that my grandfather had built. She hadn’t been back since just after I was born. All I knew was that mum had a hard life there. She was the youngest of 10 kids and many of them had already moved out. Because her parents had a difficult relationship, she and her favourite sister Sydney were often left alone in this isolated farmhouse from the ages of seven and eight. Apparently, when dad was courting mum, he would carry a pistol because of the bears and cougars. It was so remote, it wasn’t like you could call the police if you had a problem. I had visions of the unnerving movie Deliverance, with city folk encountering wild mountain men, fearing for their lives, and the tinkling of banjos. Despite that, I was looking forward to leaving the city. It had been a rough couple of months. My dad had been working for a trucking firm, which was bought by the mob from   who sold everything and eventually laid him off. It was a shock. Along with my older brother and sister, we were now a family of five living off my mum’s salary from a phone company. We all piled into dad’s 1974 Buick as long as a boat and drove for the “short” trip that was seven hours long. When we finally got to the mountain, it was all hairpin turns, no guard rails and steep drops like in the Italian Alps. My dad couldn’t handle the driving so my mum took over. She was fearless.  All of a sudden there was a commotion and we ground to a halt. I gingerly popped my head up. Coming steaming towards us on this single track was a huge backhoe [digger], driven at speed by a nutty guy with six kids swinging off it, like it was a playset. Mum rolled down the window to yell at him; he yelled back. As I peeked through the window, I asked “Mum, who is that?” She replied nonchalantly: “Oh, that’s your uncle Garcy.” She got out of the car and he jumped down off the hoe and they chatted, but there was no warmth. She later told me he was a coalminer who still lived on the mountain in a cinderblock trailer on a farm, with his wife and 21 children. Eventually, we got to the old farmhouse. Except for my uncle Garcy, all the family had moved to nearby states because unless you were a coalminer, there wasn’t a whole lot to do. Nobody had lived in the house since the early 1960s, so it had almost been reclaimed by the land. There was a tree in the front room, and debris everywhere, along with snakes and other undesirables. The fancy red and gold wallpaper had survived, along with the pot-bellied stove and stack to the ceiling.  Mum showed us the bedroom she shared with Sydney, the remnants of the kitchen and, as we walked around the vast property, the falling down barn with the basketball hoop made from an actual basket and the river that ran behind it. Down a half-mile path was the old family coal mine, which was for their personal cooking and heating. One of mum’s jobs when she was little was to take her bucket and collect coal every night. That image has always stayed with me. I was struck by how remote it was, the opposite of our neighbourhood in Richmond. Here, there was a stillness in the air, birdsong and the faint hum of farm machinery in the distance. Mum told us stories of Walter Bundy, their family doctor, arriving by mule if he needed to be called, especially for all of their home births. But over the years, mum learnt how to deal with any bumps, scraps and upsets stoically in their mountain way.  I could see why she’d had to be so self-reliant and independent. You couldn’t just pop down to the shops or service station. She could fix cars, shoot vermin, grow and cook vegetables from a young age. Near the end of her life, she told me how many times she came close to dying on that mountain and how she never wanted that to happen to her kids, which is why she was glad to escape to the city.  It was that trip, and my mum’s tales, that inspired my novel Wish You Well. The great-grandmother, Louisa Mae, and granddaughter, Lou, were based on my mum and grandmother, and I modelled George Davis after my uncle Garcy, who lived into his 80s despite his black lung from coal mining.  That trip changed my life; it gave me a greater appreciation of the hardships my mum had to go through and how she wanted things to be better for us. I certainly didn’t take things for granted any more afterwards."

culture,,,,,"There is a   in County Durham to match anywhere in England. I am reminded of this by the new edition of   for the county (Yale, £45), published this week. When one thinks of the county one thinks principally of the city of Durham, and the awesome prospect of the great cathedral, monastery and castle on the hill in the loop in the River Wear, which the Pevsner guide calls “one of the great experiences of Europe to the eyes of those who appreciate architecture”, comparing it with Prague and Avignon. The townscape around the medieval buildings has been little impaired, with a fine mixture of late Georgian and Victorian shops and houses: though the guide criticises the pedestrianisation of parts, and the removal of statues to create something called, hideously, “an event space”. Otherwise, one sees a sight familiar to generations, dominated by the mighty cathedral, which the guide claims has “stylistic supremacy over all Norman buildings in England or Normandy” and is “one of the most perfect and also historically most interesting buildings in Europe”. There is certainly no greater Norman building in England; it was begun in 1093, just 27 years after the Conquest, and is a feast of Norman work, decoration and massiveness, inside and out; most of what one sees outside dates after the 12th century. We do not know the architect who laid out the plan of the cathedral 930 years ago, but experts suspect that, because of the knowledge of Anglo-Saxon motifs he seems to have had and expressed in the ornamentation of the building, he may well have been English rather than Norman – and thus, one suspects, engaging in a mildly subversive act. Because of the distance from London, the Bishop of Durham had in his diocese powers normally accorded to a sovereign – the guide likens him to a prince-bishop of the German lands in the same era. His great cathedral, on its hill, was a constant reminder to the indigenous English of the people who had become their masters. There is no clearer example of the Normans’ habitual use of architecture to overwhelm and to intimidate than this cathedral’s great crossing-tower, 218 feet high. Pevsner sums up the exterior as “strong and forbidding”. Inside, the visitor is overpowered by the height of the rib vaults, not just the first to be found on a cathedral in England, but possibly the first of any Norman cathedral, which had hitherto had flat roofs inside. The guide says the interior has changed so little since 1133 that when one enters and looks down the nave, one sees the work of the original architect just as he intended it – “the forms are domineering to the utmost, without, however, being brutal”. Apart from the height, the procession of great circular stone piers towards the east end is the memory one takes away, with their unusual criss-cross and diagonally grooved designs; and when one reaches the east end, in the choir, one is in the oldest part of the cathedral. As befitted a prince-bishop, this one had, until the Reformation, a castle as a palace. The castle of Durham pre-dates the cathedral, having been started in 1072, but not finished until the 13th century. After the Restoration it was refurbished and inhabited, sporadically, by bishops until 1836, when the University of Durham took it over. The university has contributed much architecture of its own to the city – some grand, some dull, some a tribute to the massive self-regard of the architect, as in Daniel Libeskind’s Ogden Centre for Fundamental Physics, finished in 2017. One would need weeks to . Despite Viking raids it retains fine Saxon churches, notably at Jarrow and Escomb. It teems with castles that have been continuously inhabited, such as at Lumley and Raby. Wynyard Park, seat of Lord Londonderry, built in the 1820s by Philip Wyatt to a design by his brother Benjamin, is one of the great stately homes of England, the result of the 3rd Marquess’s decision that “the erection of a seat of suitable grandeur… was now an immediate necessity”. All this grandeur sits among fine relics of industrial architecture, in a county torn up in parts by the industrial revolution, and which was the nursery of railways. This exhaustive and scholarly book makes discovering this cornucopia a revelation and a delight."

Is this the most politically correct sitcom on TV – or the most offensive?

Tackling the aftermath of the war in Afghanistan with a diverse cast, The United States of Al is doing everything right. Why the backlash?
",Ed Power,"
24 March 2021 • 12:20pm
","People are angry at Chuck Lorre. And for once it has nothing to do with  . Lorre’s cheesy nerd “comedy” – the humour was an acquired taste in the way a hernia is an acquired taste –  had half the world in hackles for a decade. But network television’s most powerful producer has moved on – to offending social media via an upcoming sitcom about the experiences of Afghan interpreters who have relocated to the United States.  Diversity, the fall-out from America’s long war in the Middle East, charges of cultural appropriation and gags courtesy of the guy who made  the best paid man on TV (with Two and a Half Men)…It was always going to be an unstable concoction. Just how unstable was made horribly clear when the trailer for the United States of Al debuted on CBS at the weekend.  “White saviour,” said some on Twitter after the preview of the show showed an “Afghan” character who has relocated to the US under Washington’s Special Immigrant Visa programme (SIV) and is living with a white US marine. “To see an American soldier hosting an Afghan [war interpreter] in the US and letting him live with his family does romanticise forces which killed, tortured, and unlawfully imprisoned thousands of Afghan civilians,” added another commentator. “Very disappointing from you.” Other criticisms centred on the fact that the lead character of Awalmir – “Al” – is played by Adhir Kalyan, who is of South Asian descent and was born in South Africa. “Finally, a groundbreaking show that will help Americans understand the plight of Indian actors playing magical Afghans to hunky gentle white supermodel saviours who are “tired from war because there is so much walking”,” activist Rafael Shimunov tweeted. And yet to paint Lorre as a perpetrator of the white saviour myth and eraser of cultural identity is arguably wide of the mark. The Big Bang Theory gave a starring role to Indian-American actor Kunal Nayyar – making it 1,000 per cent more diverse than Friends, Alan Partridge, Ricky Gervais’s The Office combined. Lorre, moreover, went out of his way to recruit a writer with a Nigerian background for his CBS show, Bob Hearts Abishola. He cold-called and hired Nigerian-British writer and comedian Gina Yashere after seeing her on YouTube –giving her the sort of opportunity she had never been afforded in the UK.  “So, originally, I was brought on as a consultant on all things African. It sounded weird to me,” Yashere told Insider, recounting her first meeting with Lorre. “Once I got in the room with the guys, I began to really like them. I could see that they were trying to make a really good show, and it wasn't really an exploitative thing.” He has also confronted the entrenched ageism of Hollywood with his Netflix hit the Kominsky Method, starring septuagenarians Michael Douglas and Alan Arkin.  And he has been one of the few senior executives in network TV to speak out about the importance of representation and of bringing a perspective to comedy that goes beyond the traditional white one. You can argue he has done so in incredibly broad and creaky fashion. But it is difficult to question his good intentions.  “You recognise your own blind spots, if you’re paying attention. You recognise your inclination is to surround yourself with more of you — people that reflect you and reflect your background. And that in and of itself is destructive and you don’t recognise it until you’re shown an alternative way of doing things,” is how Lorre outlined his philosophy towards representation in an interview with the LA Times last year.  “So it’s still a learning process. I’ve not stopped learning how to do this and not just the writing and the production and the editing and all the minutiae of making a television show. But the people you work with, that door [into industry positions] has to be much wider,” he continued.  “At a certain point, you realise you have responsibility to create a more welcoming environment and make it possible for a broader spectrum of writing viewpoints, bringing different experiences into the process, so it’s not all Long Island Jews in the room.” None of which is to suggest the United States of Al may not be problematic. The name certainly has issues: is it ever appropriate to shorten “Awalmir” to Al? And there is always the danger of rendering a member of a minority as “the other”, or milking their “exotic” background for laughs. If that is the case, Twitter criticism will have of course been vindicated.  But it feels significant that the pushback against these attacks have come not from Lorre but from the series’s Tehran-born executive producer, the academic and journalist Reza Aslan, whose CV includes the Secret Life of Muslims and The Leftovers.  This isn’t the first Twitter flap in which Aslan has been embroiled. He stood up to the narrow-mindedness of Fox News in a 2013 viral interview in which the interviewer asked how Aslan, a Muslim, could write a book about Jesus. “I am a scholar of religions with four degrees, including one in the New Testament, and fluency in biblical Greek, who has been studying the origins of Christianity for two decades, who also just happens to be a Muslim,” he said. “It's not that I'm just some Muslim writing about Jesus,"" he continued. ""I am an expert with a PhD in the history of religions.” He has, it is true, been caught up in previous controversies. His CNN series Believer With Reza Aslan drew charges of sensationalism after a scene in which, participating in a religious ceremony with India’s nomadic Aghori sect, he nibbled on human brain. “Want to know what a dead guy’s brain tastes like?” he later wrote on Facebook. “Charcoal. It was burnt to a crisp!"" The Aghori are Hindu and the segment was accused of misrepresenting the religion. “With multiple reports of hate-fuelled attacks against people of Indian origin from across the US, the show characterises Hinduism as cannibalistic, which is a bizarre way of looking at the third largest religion in the world,” said the lobby group US India Political Action Committees.  “It is unbelievably callous and reckless of CNN to be pushing sensational and grotesque images of bearded brown men and their morbid and deathly religion at a time when the United States is living through a period of unprecedented concern and fear,” added Vamsee Juluri, a media studies professor from the University of California, in a Huffington Post article.  Aslan has come out swinging in his defence of the United States of Al, pointing out that those rushing to condemn the series were doing so on the basis of a trailer. “You can’t judge a show by a 30 sec trailer,” he said on social media. “Well, you shouldn’t, at least. Still this is Twitter...” “I’m just ok with your opinion,” he continued. “Just wish it was based on facts not feels. I get it. My whole life I’ve been misrepresented on TV. That’s why I came to Hollywood to change that. You don’t have to support the effort. But maybe watch it then s— on it not other way round.” He also insisted the producers had worked hard at casting an Afghan lead. “There are five Afghan characters in the show and four of them are played by Afghans. We saw 100 Afghan leads but sitcom is a specialised genre and it’s very tough to play. But we also have four Afghan writers/producers on the show who’ve done a great job helping Adhir.” As he says, the United States of Al is diverse behind the scenes; certainly on paper it appears nothing but well-intentioned and has the ingredients of the most politically correct sitcom ever seen on US primetime TV. Among the four people from Afghanistan in the writers’ room, is a former interpreter who came to the US on a Fulbright scholarship. It will also touch on taboos such as PTSD. “I get it we are all traumatised but sometimes it's best not to shoot first and ask questions later,” tweeted Mayhad Tousi, an executive producer alongside Aslan. “The show works hand in hand with two organisations – No One Left Behind and International Refugee Assistance Project – to make sure we aren't just talking about SIV program and the plight of Afghan interpreters,” added Aslan. “We are trying to do something about it. Actually changing policy.” The United States of Al arrives at a timely moment, with the Trump White House accused of “closing the door” on Iraqi translators who worked with US forces and are seeking visas to the US. In 2019 one translator, Shaker Jeffrey, said delays to the SIV programme had put him in danger from Islamic fundamentalists.  “I am a hunted man,"" Jeffrey, who had been waiting for a visa for 10 years, told NBC from Germany. “If I return to Iraq, I will be assassinated.” The figures are chilling. In 2016, 325 Iraqi translators received SIV visas. By 2018, the figure had dropped to two. “It remains unclear why the number of visas issued to Iraqi interpreters has declined so dramatically, said NBC “But refugee advocates and lawmakers say it appears to be a case of collateral damage from the Trump administration's overall crackdown on immigration and refugees. As to the “white saviour” premise of an Afghan interpreter living with a US marine  – this was based on reality, Aslan continued. “You are literally talking about a true story. There are dozens and dozens of Afghan interpreters living with US soldiers. We know cause we actually spoke to them. This is literally their story.” Critics will point out that Aslan would of course defend his show; and the jury is still out on whether he and Lorre have been able to strike the correct tone. All will be revealed on April 1 when the United States of Al debuts.  One thing that is certain, however, is that the producers may want to stay off Twitter for the time being. Lorre might be about to be caught up in the biggest controversy since Charlie Sheen went full “tiger blood” on him 10 years ago. "

The director who dared to make a film about the Prophet Muhammad
","
Moustapha Akkad's epic The Message sparked boycotts, protests and an armed siege for depicting Islam's founder on screen – except it hadn't
",Tom Fordy,"
30 March 2021 • 4:00pm
","In July 1976, director-producer Moustapha Akkad was forced to change the name of his $17 million Islamic epic – from “Muhammad, Messenger of God” to simply “The Message” – just 72 hours before the London premiere. As will be obvious to anyone who has been following  , the change came after protests – including threatening phone calls to one cinema – from conservative Muslims who wrongly believed the film would depict the Prophet Muhammad. But in The Message, the Syrian-born, American-trained Moustapha Akkad told the story of Muhammad and the birth of  without showing the Prophet.  “The Islamic religion forbids the portrayal of Muhammad,” Akkad told the Associated Press in 1976. “I solved that by having the camera act as the eyes of Muhammad. He is never seen, nor does he speak, but you feel his presence as the action swirls around him.” The last-minute title change cost a reported $100,000, and followed months of wavering support and outrage from Muslim leaders and theologians. Tragically, it would not be the film's last controversy. The Message was banned throughout the Arab world, and in March 1977 – as the film was set to open in the US – 12 Hanafi Muslim gunmen took 149 hostages in Washington DC.  Among their demands was that the film be banned. ""We want the picture out of the country,"" the group's leader declared. ""Because it's a fairy tale, it's a joke… I'm Muslim and I'll die for my faith. It's a joke. It's misrepresenting the Muslim faith."" In a siege that lasted 39 hours, a young radio reporter was killed and dozens more were injured. “When we made this film we really thought we were involved in a great event,” said lead actor Anthony Quinn. “I thought I was doing something worthwhile. I knew there were dangers. I knew I might be criticised. Here I thought I was doing a good deed, and it winds up like this.” Moustapha Akkad – who was mentored by Sam Peckinpah and later produced the Halloween films – envisioned The Message as a tribute to the story of Islam, and to bring the story to Western audiences. “Being Muslim myself who lived in the West, I felt that it's my obligation, my duty, to tell the truth about Islam,” Akkad said in 1976. ""I thought I should tell the story that will bring this bridge.” He also said: “I think people in the Western word will be interested in learning about the Muslim religion. Nobody here knows that Islam believes in Christ, and Noah, and all the prophets, and the virginity of Mary.” Actor Garrick Hagon – who played Ammar, one of Muhammad's most loyal companions – admitted his own ignorance. “At that time, we didn't know much about Islam,” he told NPR in 2016. “Muhammad was a name, and that was about all. So it was all pretty much of a revelation.” The project first began in 1971. Akkad was inspired by Lawrence of Arabia – specifically, the majestic introduction of Omar Sharif, who rides towards Peter O’Toole from across the sands and through the rippling mirage. The Messenger was imagined in the style of the biblical epics – a big budget Koranic epic to match the likes of Charlton Heston's The Ten Commandments. H.A.L. Craig – writer of Waterloo and Airport ’77 – was commissioned to write the screenplay. It was closely vetted for approval by Islamic scholars at the Al Azhar University in Cairo and the High Islamic Congress of the Shiat in Lebanon. As if it wasn't ambitious enough already, Akkad decided to shoot two versions of the film – an English-language version with a Western cast, and an Arabic version with leading Muslim film stars. Respective scenes would be shot one after the other. Speaking at the time, Akkad joked that Charlton Heston – the square-jawed hero of the day, and a regular in biblical blockbusters – shouldn’t get the lead role. But there was still controversy about Heston’s non-involvement: the Voice of America radio station mistakenly reported that Heston had been cast as the Prophet Muhammad, which ignited rioting in Muslim Pakistan. The commanding Anthony Quinn was cast as Hamza, a sword-wielding warrior and the uncle of Muhammad. Quinn was a two-time Oscar winner and no stranger to the religious epic – he also played Barabbas in 1961. Quinn’s counterpart in the Arabic version of the film was Egyptian actor Abdullah Ghaith.  Also cast in the English version was Irene Papas as Hind, a Meccan woman who rejects Muhammad’s message, but later becomes Muslim; Damien Thomas as Zayd, Muhammad’s adopted son and follower; and Robert Brown – M in the James Bond series between 1983 and 1989 – as Utbah, a Quraysh antagonist who battles the Prophet’s followers. As reported at the time, Muhammad Ali, who had converted to Islam 10 years earlier, harangued Akkad for the role of Bilal, a former slave and the first muezzin to call to prayer.  But the role went to Johnny Sekka, a Gambian actor who had made the call to prayer at mosque as a child. “I approached it with great reverence, wanting to do the best possible job,” said Sekka in 1977. “I tried to ponder, ‘How was it done the first day when Billal made the call?’” His call to prayer is among the most powerful scenes in the film – a booming, emotional chorus that puts the other characters at a standstill. Speaking in 1976, Akkad explained that he’d secured initial financing for the film from “sources in the United States, Kuwait, Saudi Arabia, Libya and Morroco”. There was resistance from the start. On his first trip to Libya to find money, Akkad was stopped at the airport and sent back on his way. Also, the king of Saudi Arabia, Faisal bin Abdulaziz Al Saud, refused him permission to shoot the film in Saudi. Filming began in 1974, just outside of Marrakech, Morocco, where they built a replica of Mecca for a reported $700,000. The production included a 300-strong international crew (with 28 nationalities), crowds of 5,000 extras, two casts of 40 actors each, and herds of horses and camels. Though Muhammad himself doesn't appear, the techniques still hold up. The Prophet’s presence is felt, almost eerily in places, but he's never seen or heard. Other characters repeat his words and address Muhammad by talking directly into the camera – a striking effect that strangely puts the viewer in the place of the Prophet. The camera becomes Muhammad's point of the view. “I’ve never been involved in a picture in which everyone bent over backward as we did because of the delicateness of the situation,” Anthony Quinn told People Magazine. “The filming took a year, and we had six high priests with us constantly as advisers.” The closest we get to Muhammad is seeing the head of his camel, as the Prophet leads his followers to Medina, or his staff. “I never intended to portray Muhammad, just as I wouldn’t portray Jesus or other religious leaders,” said Akkad. “Not because of any religious reasons. I simply don’t believe in it artistically.” Indeed, there were a number of films about Christianity that treated the image of Jesus with similar reverence. In the 1939 film The Great Commandment, Jesus appears as a reflection, light, and voice; and like the Prophet in The Message, we see Jesus’s point of view. Other films, such as Quo Vadis, Ben-Hur, and Barabbas, featured only glimpses of Jesus (or just a limb), or brief cameo appearances. As recently as 2001, a short called The Cross followed The Message by shooting from Jesus’s POV. As ingenious as Akkad’s approach was, he still faced problems from Muslim leaders. The king of Saudi Arabia put pressure on the Moroccan government, which ultimately expelled Akkad and his production from the country. “There was an air of uncertainty on the set,” recalled Johnny Sekka in 1977. “We constantly heard rumours of a shutdown because many leaders of the Arab world were against the film. That situation was inflamed by reports in the West that Quinn was playing the Prophet.  “Akkad left the set one day to visit the king of Morocco. When he returned, he told us, ‘This film will be made. Nothing will stop us.’ But one day the soldiers arrived and production was shut down.” The Message was rescued by an unlikely hero – Libya’s Colonel Muammar Gaddafi, who reportedly wept when he saw the footage that Akkad had already captured. Gaddafi allowed Akkad to relocate production near the desert town of Sebham, south of the Libyan capital Tripoli, and sent 3,000 troops to be used in battle scenes. Speaking to NPR about Akkad's arrangement with Gaddafi – who later became America’s enemy number one – Akkad’s son, Malek Akkad, said, “My father was of one mind, that he was going to finish this film. And so where he could get assistance from, he did.” The film took more than a year to make. Shooting the English and Arabic scenes together was laborious and costly. “I didn’t realise how much longer the Arabic version would take,” Akkad told the Associated Press. “The Arabic language is much more flowery, and the actors are more dramatic with their gestures.” During the post-production, Akkad was optimistic about the reception. “There are 700 million Muslims in the world, and there is a great interest in the Middle East for the film,” he said. “There is also a curiosity about the title and the subject in the West. My picture won’t be a Jaws but I think it will be well received here. There seems to be a return to spirituality today, as the machine is taking over.” But the Cairo scholars who had approved the script withdrew support and branded The Message “an insult to Islam”. Several countries – including Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, and Egypt – banned it. In London, the title change didn’t entirely solve the problem. When The Observer’s Russell Davies went to review The Message, there was a bomb scare at the screening. (“Three and a bit [hours] with intermission,” he wrote about the film’s lengthy runtime. “Three and a lot with bomb scare.”) The film was a reasonable success in Europe and Akkad eventually found a distributor for the US. It was due to open on March 9, 1977. That day, fanatical gunmen took three buildings in Washington DC and held around 149 people. They had other demands, including the handover of men who had killed the family – including children – of their leader, Hamaas Abdul Khaalis. The men weren't released, but the terrorists' other demand was met. The film was pulled in New York and Los Angeles - the projectors ground to a halt mid-screening - and reopened once the gunmen had surrendered. It's doubtful that Khaalis actually watched The Message, but many who did liked it. Muhammad Ali praised Johnny Sekka’s performance. “Johnny you have made me so proud,” Ali told him. “I have seen Superfly and the other ways blacks have been depicted in films. I’ve never seen a role with such dignity.” The film’s score, by Maurice Jarre (who also composed the scores for Lawrence of Arabia and Dr Zhivago), was nominated for an Academy Award. Tragically, Moustapha Akkad and his daughter, Rima Akkad Monla, were killed in a hotel bombing in Amman, Jordan in November 2005. Akkad was 75; Rima was 34. Akkad did see The Message accepted by Muslim countries. Speaking in 1981, he described how the ban had been lifted. “In the last two years The Message has been playing in Muslim countries,” he said. “It was just a matter of their seeing the film and realising it contained nothing offensive. Now it is playing everywhere in the Arab world.”"

Questor: H&T’s Covid recovery may not be quick but it has net cash and a decent yield
","
Questor share tip: the pawnbroker’s profits could fall in the short term but lowly valuation offers plenty of scope for share price gains
",Russ Mould,"
30 March 2021 • 5:00am
","Limited high street footfall, a reduced loan book and uncertainty over the unsecured lending operation all mean that analysts expect profits to drop in the coming year at H&T, and as a result the shares may not quickly recoup even the limited ground lost since  . But the firm is the market leader in its primary business of pawnbroking, the balance sheet is strong and the respectable dividend yield looks well covered, so patient investors can stick with the stock. January’s trading statement had already flagged a strong end to the 2020 calendar year, so last week’s full-year results contained few surprises. The pledge book shrank by a third and operating profits by a quarter as a result of temporary store closures, social distancing requirements when they reopened and subdued demand for new loans. In addition, H&T did its best to help customers in need by freezing interest payments during store closures and offering payment deferrals where appropriate. The payment of interim and final dividends in 2020, after the prudent decision to pass 2019’s final distribution, speaks of confidence in the future. Even if 2021 could be another testing year, H&T’s pawnbroking arm provides a valuable service to those who have difficulty getting credit elsewhere. An online payment portal is a useful new service for customers and the Surrey-based company also offers click-and-collect services at its jewellery retail business via a newly refreshed website. Higher levels of activity on the high street and increased demand for short-term loans could help the pledge book to grow steadily once more. Higher gold prices would be a further bonus, as would any resumption of international travel for the currency exchange operations. None of these may happen quickly, but the balance sheet has net cash even after lease liabilities are accounted for, while the forecast yield of 3.2pc also means shareholders can afford to wait for a potential profit uptick in 2022 and beyond. The forecast price-to-earnings ratio of almost 16 may not seem quite so appealing but that figure is the result of the subdued profit expected for the year. The firm made 43.8p in earnings per share in 2019 and the stock trades on just 6.7 times that figure. There is still clear recovery potential here.  A bid last week from Bally’s, an American casino and racetrack operator, means we may truly have  , the gaming services firm that once went by the name of JackpotJoy. Bally’s is offering £18.50 a share in cash or the option to accept all, or a portion, of the offer in its own, New York-listed stock. The proposed ratio is 0.343 of a Bally’s share to each Gamesys share. A price of $73.63 for Bally’s, after some smart gains in the wake of the announcement, and an exchange rate of $1.3762 mean this equates to £18.35 at the time of writing. Gamesys’s shares have shot past the offer price, even though there is no guarantee that the proposed deal will be consummated. This implies that the market thinks a counter-bid may be in the offing, or at least that Bally’s may have to go higher to net its prize amid the frenzy that surrounds the gaming market as America deregulates and US firms seek technological expertise so they can capitalise. The shares stood at 800p when this column  , so cautious investors may choose to sell a few shares now above the offer price – perhaps enough to cover their initial investment – and lock in their gains. Others may elect to spin the wheel and wait to see what happens next. The only bad news is that our decision earlier this month to   now looks distinctly premature. Having already doubled, 888’s shares have romped higher by some 50pc in the past week to offer further proof, as if it were needed, that financial markets will always keep you humble. It could be worth holding on to Gamesys, however."

Comedy’s finest crack-up: how Reginald Perrin made middle-class monotony funny
","
David Nobbs’s landmark 1970s sitcom was dark, melancholic and often profound. And its long absence from our screens has only made it better
",Tom Fordy,"
9 March 2021 • 12:47pm
","“Mother rang – she wants to know if we’re going to see her on Sunday.” Cue the image of a hippopotamus trotting through the mud. The best-remembered gag from The Fall and Rise of Reginald Perrin is – almost 45 years since it first aired – still very funny. Sure, that hippo trots right into the category of standard Seventies mother-in-law material, but there’s really nothing standard about The Fall and Rise of Reginald Perrin, which is now being repeated on BBC Four after being absent from our screens for decades.  Though set in the leafy south London suburb of ‘Climthorpe’, it’s not a cosy living room comedy; nor a sitcom in which the characters’ weekly schemes revert, as most sitcoms do, to a familiar status quo before the following week’s episode. Rather, Reggie Perrin – played with manic, melancholic brilliance by – lives a middling life: middle-aged, middle-class, middle-management. And en route to a breakdown – via the daily commute to his job at Sunshine Desserts. According to open titles, Reggie has “begun to behave very oddly!” The stress, boredom, and inevitable crack-up cause Perrin to fake his own death. It’s a surreal, satirical journey that edges towards occasional man-on-the-brink darkness. But between meltdowns Reggie would call himself an “ordinary bloke”. As he tells his wife Elizabeth – the delectably charming Pauline Yates – at the beginning of the third series: “I’m no different from anyone else who walked out on a job, faked suicide, started a new life, returned in disguise, remarried his wife, opened a shop selling goods guaranteed absolutely useless, to his amazement succeeded, walked out again, faked another suicide, and started another new life.” The series was written by  and adapted from his own series of novels, the first of which was The Death of Reginald Perrin – published in 1975. Nobbs, who died in 2015, got his start in comedy by writing sketches for That Was the Week That Was. He also wrote for heavyweight names that included Les Dawson, Frankie Howerd, Ken Dodd, Tommy Cooper, Dick Emery, and the Two Ronnies. Nobbs created Reggie Perrin after the BBC asked him to submit an idea for a half hour play about social problems, as part of a series. His pitch – about a man driven mad by his commute – was rejected. But Nobbs turned the idea into a novel. The original draft had a slightly different twist – the early incarnation of Perrin ended up in a psychiatric home rather than faking his own death. In his autobiography, Nobbs recalled some inspirations, including an article he’d read about the tedious process that a jam manufacturer went through to create a new flavour; and a mortgage company advert with a nauseatingly smug family in matching outfits. “In my mind this was a key image for the world against which Reggie was rebelling,” wrote Nobbs. Also, as a child, Nobbs would get the train to school, surrounded each morning by the type of commuters that Reginald Perrin was doomed to become – pinstriped suits, umbrellas, newspapers. Nobbs wanted   for the role of Perrin, and Barker was certainly a fan. “I laughed two hundred and eighty-seven times and cried twice,” said Barker about reading Nobbs’s book. “I would love to play Reggie Perrin in a film. I still feel I am Reggie Perrin as I walk about. What a beautiful book.” Granada offered to make it as a two-part drama with Barker, but Nobbs’s agent insisted it should be a sitcom at the BBC. “I couldn’t believe my ears,” said Nobbs. “My novel a sit-com!” When Nobbs went for a meeting with Jimmy Gilbert, the Head of Comedy at the BBC, Gilbert asked if he had anyone in mind for the role of Reggie Perrin. “Yes, Ronnie Barker,” said Nobbs. Gilbert replied: “Very good. Leonard Rossiter it is.” Rossiter had become a star from his performance as Rigsby, the lecherous, misery-guts landlord in the hit ITV sitcom Rising Damp. Nobbs admitted that he was disappointed at first but soon changed his mind. “Suddenly I felt that he might be irresistible in The Fall and Rise of Reginald Perrin,” Nobbs wrote about Rossiter. The first series began broadcasting on September 8, 1976. Watched now, it’s still joyously unusual – not to mention strangely relatable, as Reggie tries to escape the monotonous, middle class existence which closes in on him. Each morning he kisses his wife at the door; each morning he walks the same streets of the “Poets Estate” – through Coleridge Close, Tennyson Avenue, and Wordsworth Drive; and each day suffers the banality of a so-called-life inside Sunshine Desserts. The Fall and Rise of Reginald Perrin perfectly captures 1970s Britain, with its drab interiors, processed puddings, and manufacturing decline – even the Sunshine Desserts sign is crumbling from above the door, one letter at a time. Perrin is plagued by visions: not just his mother-in-law as a hippo, but him flashing at a neighbour on his way to work, torturing his boss on a rack, and rapturous trysts with his secretary Joan (Corrie’s Sue Nicholls). The fractured state of Reggie’s mind shows with his increasingly outlandish excuses for being late into the office every day: “Eleven minutes late, somebody had stolen the lines at Surbiton… Seventeen minutes late, water seeping through the cables at Effingham Junction – there was a lot of Effingham and a good deal of Blindingham… Twenty-two minutes late, escaped puma, Chessington North.” Indeed, seen from Reggie’s perspective, the real world is slightly skew whiff: there's a fellow commuter who blows his nose on various newspaper supplements; his brother-in-law Jimmy (the deadpan Geoffrey Palmer), forever dropping by to blag the contents of their fridge – “Bit of a cock-up on the catering front”; and a family trip to a safari park so infuriating that Reggie gets out of the car while in the lion park. (Nobbs recalled that while shooting the scenes at Longleat, a coachload of Welsh pensioners came into the area and excitedly photographed the lions – but the lions quickly revealed themselves to be BBC props men in costumes.) There’s humanity in Leonard Rossiter’s finely-tuned performance – a bundle of repression and desperation. According to Nobbs, Rossiter was a “perfectionist and not always easy to work with”. In the best episode, Reggie plans to have an affair with his secretary Joan while his wife’s away. It goes wrong when all of the family decide to pop round at the same time, forcing Reggie to keep his fancy woman hidden in the bedroom while he distracts everyone else, trying to keep them from going upstairs. In those scenes he’s possessed by a wild-eyed mania, stumbling over his words with rapid-fire, precision-perfect delivery. “Leonard could express the anxieties Reggie was experiencing in every move, expression and word he uttered,” said Nobbs. ""He could also combine pace with subtlety, which is very difficult. Most actors who try being subtle come across as slow, but not Leonard – he could rattle the lines out at a rate of knots while still retaining that degree of delicacy."" You do have to admire Reggie’s gumption to reject modern life. There’s a sense of wish-fulfillment as he plunges into crack-pottery. In one sequence he dreams of pelting muck at his boss, the pompous C.J. (John Barron); in the real world, he can’t suppress what he really thinks any longer. “I can’t be bothered with this,” he says during a sales meeting. “Life’s too short.”  Eventually, Perrin fakes his own death by leaving his clothes on a beach in Dorset and heading into the sea. He then switches between various identities, with daft wigs and buck teeth. But he misses his family and returns home in the guise of bearded alter-ego Martin Wellbourne, and remarries Elizabeth. As Martin he even attends his own memorial service – a deceptively dark, psychologically troubling scenario. The show is not entirely free of old school sitcom fare. There’s rude humour, of course – the kind that seemed to make Seventies studio audiences howl saucily, such as a recurring joke about chairs that make a whoopee cushion noise whenever sat on. That gag actually came from Nobbs’s first visit to Jimmy Gilbert’s office. His chair sounded “like a cross between a muffled fart and an elderly toad’s sigh of satisfaction,” said Nobbs. There are plenty of catchphrases. too The likes of “Great!” and “Super!” soon get old – the respective catchphrases of junior yes men Tony and David (Trevor Adams and Bruce Bould) – but C.J.’s patented “I didn’t get to where I am today…” is funny every time, and delightfully nonsensical. (See: “I didn't get where I am today without knowing a real winner when I see one”; “I didn't get where I am today by indulging in hanky panky”; and “I didn't get where I am today by having green frogs thrust down my crotch”.) Nobbs knew the show was a hit when he heard some businessmen bantering in a hotel lobby. “I’m going up the stairs,” he heard one of them say. “I didn’t get where I am today by waiting for lifts.” “Great,” another man replied. “Super,” said the other. In 1977, Nobbs published a follow-up novel, The Return of Reginald Perrin. He had to – Leonard Rossiter would agree to a second series only if Nobbs wrote a second book too. He believed that’s where the depth of the show came from. In the second series, Perrin returns to his real identity – his wife Elizabeth seems surprisingly fine with the whole charade – and tries to have one more laugh at society’s expense by opening a shop called Grot, which proudly sells useless, overpriced rubbish. But the business is a huge success, which sees Reggie trapped in the rat race once again and trying – but failing – to sabotage his own business empire. He contemplates faking his death once again, but this time with Elizabeth. A third series followed in 1978 – based on book No. 3, The Better World of Reginald Perrin – in which Reggie and Elizabeth try to set up a utopia-like community for middle-class middle-aged people. It’s the weakest series – not particularly good, in fact. An episode in which Reggie and his gang try to scare the neighbours by wearing blackface will give BBC Four some pause for thought. A fourth series was made in 1996, but this time without Rossiter, who died in 1984. In The Legacy of Reginald Perrin, his friends and family each inherited £1 million, on the condition they “do something totally and utterly absurd”. Martin Clunes also played the character in a 2009 revival. The first series stands up as Reggie Perrin's finest few hours. It's even profound – a cynical assessment of an ordinary life. No matter what he does, he’s never happy. As Reginald Perrin says himself: “Sheer bliss isn’t enough!”"

","The   is, says our film critic,  , properly showcasing British talent as well as honouring the best work from the international scene. Of course,   in the UK until May 17. So, where and how can you see all these great movies?   Chloé Zhao’s  , about America’s drifters, is the joint leader with seven nominations, including nods for Best Film, Best Director and Frances McDormand for Best Actress. Nomadland premieres on Disney+ (£7.99 a month) on April 30, and will be in UK cinemas when they reopen - so likely mid May. The other film boasting seven nominations is Sarah Gavron’s  , with well-deserved nods for its talented newcomers - Bukky Bakray and Kosar Ali. Rocks had a modest run in cinemas last year, and is now available on Netflix (from £5.99 a month), but is surely due another theatrical release too. The film adaptation of Florian Zeller’s  , about a man suffering from dementia, is up for six awards, including Best Film and Best Actor for Anthony Hopkins. Although it premiered at Sundance over a year ago, it hasn’t yet been released in UK cinemas, but good news: it’s due out on June 11.  Emerald Fennell’s dark-comedy rape revenge   has been an awards season talking point - boosted by star   with a Variety film reviewer. It’s up for six awards, including Best Film, and UK viewers can finally see it when it comes to Sky Cinema and streaming service NOW on April 16.  about the finding of Sutton Hoo in 1939 - again starring Mulligan, this time alongside Ralph Fiennes - has five nominations, its best bet probably Moira Buffini’s screenplay. The Dig had a limited cinema release in January and is now available on Netflix, but don’t rule out a return to the big screen.  of a South Korean family pursuing the American dream has six nods - including Best Director, and Best Supporting Actor for the adorable Alan Kim. It will have an initial on demand and virtual cinema release via minari.film from April 2, and will hopefully hit cinemas when they reopen. Hollywood lore always does well in awards season, and   about the writer of Citizen Kane, Herman J Mankiewicz, is no exception. It’s up for six Baftas (although misses out on some of the big ones, like Best Film and Best Director), and you can see it now on Netflix. Rose Glasss’s   sees Morfydd Clark’s Maud’s devout Catholic nurse tending to Jennifer Ehle’s terminally ill patient. It’s up for Outstanding British Film and Outstanding Debut, and following, its cinema release last October, is now available on Blu-ray and DVD, or to rent from Amazon Prime (£7.99 a month subscription, or £4.49 for a one-off rental). A crack ensemble cast revisits the story of the anti-Vietnam War protestors who were prosecuted following the riots at the National Democratic Convention in 1968.   has three nominations, including for Best Film and Aaron Sorkin’s screenplay, and is available to watch on Netflix. A surprisingly strong showing for this  , which is also inspired by true events - in this case, Mohamedou Ould Salahi being held for 14 years without charge at Guantanamo Bay. Its five nominations include Best Film, and UK viewers can see it via video on demand on Amazon Prime from April 1.  is the Danish entry for this year’s Oscars, and also picks up four nominations here, including Best Actor for Mads Mikkelsen. He plays a depressed teacher who tests out a theory that constant, low-level drinking can improve your life. It played at the London Film Festival, and is due to hit cinemas on June 25. Daniel Kaluuya has already won a Golden Globe for his performance as Fred Hampton, the Black Panther member betrayed by an FBI informant - although many are puzzled about why he’s in the Best Supporting Actor category.   is up for four Baftas total, and is available on video on demand via BFI Player and others from March 11.  is an unflinching portrait of loss, featuring a 24-minute scene of a home birth ending in tragedy. The Crown’s Vanessa Kirby scores a nomination for her extraordinary lead performance, and it’s available to watch now on Netflix. The likely winner for Best Animated Film - and also up for Best Sound and Best Original Score - is   about a jazz musician trying to reunite his body and soul, as well as figuring out his purpose in life. It premiered exclusively on Disney+ on Christmas Day 2020, and is still available on the streamer. The   of August Wilson’s stage play - about the real-life blues singer Ma Rainey - is up for three awards, including Best Actor for the late, great   as ambitious trumpeter Levee. You can catch in now on Netflix. Riz Ahmed plays a hard rock drummer and recovering addict who loses his hearing in this Darius Marder drama. He’s up for Best Actor, and the film has four nominations total. UK viewers can see it on Amazon Prime from April 12, and it will be in cinemas when they reopen, so likely May 17. Probably best known for “that scene” with Trump’s lawyer Rudy Giuliani, Sacha Baron Cohen’s   also proved a breakout role for Maria Bakalova, who played his fictional daughter Tutar, and she picks up a nomination here. You can watch it now (from behind a cushion) on Amazon Prime. The   has scored four nominations - although none for Hanks himself, playing a former Confederate officer who makes a living reading out newspapers, and who must return a young girl to her family. It’s on Netflix now. Spike Lee’s   - about four Vietnam War veterans in search of both their missing squad leader and their buried treasure - has one Bafta nod: Clarke Peters for Best Supporting Actor. It’s available to watch now on Netflix.  This propulsive adaptation of Aaravind Adiga’s Booker Prize-winning novel - which highlights inequality and corruption - sees Balram escaping from his poor Indian village by becoming the local landlord’s chauffeur. It’s nominated for its screenplay and Adarsh Gourav as Best Actor, and you can find it now on Netflix. Jasmila Žbanić is a surprise entrant in the Best Director category, and her Bosnian war drama - set during the Srebenica massacre of 1995 - is also up for Best Film Not In The English Language. It’s available on Curzon Home Video (£9.99 for non-members). Australian director Shannon Murphy is nominated for this off-kilter, powerfully acted   (based on Rita Kalnejais’ stage play). It’s about a teenage cancer sufferer - played by Eliza Scanlen - who falls in love with a drug addict, and you can watch it now on Netflix. Regina King directs the   of Kemp Powers’ stage play, about a fictional meeting between Malcolm X, Muhammad Ali, Jim Brown and Sam Cooke. Leslie Odom Jr (already a Tony winner for musical Hamilton) is nominated for Best Supporting Actor for playing Cooke, and it’s available now on Amazon Prime. Four nominations for  , an Irish crime drama about a former boxer who works as an enforcer for a criminal family. The film pivoted to a digital release last year, and is available on the likes of Amazon and iTunes (for both, £3.49 to rent), as well as BFI Player (£4.50 to rent).  Alfre Woodward has received a Best Actress nomination for playing a warden in a maximum security prison, whose growing concerns about the death penalty lead to a crisis of faith.   is available now on Amazon Prime. Kate Winslet and Saoirse Ronan star in this  , which is loosely inspired by the life of British palaeontologist Mary Anning, and has scored a Bafta nomination for its costume design. The current UK release date is March 26, presumably on a streaming platform since cinemas will still be closed.  Remi Weekes’s topical horror film sees a refugee couple from South Sudan trying to make a new life in an English town - only to discover that their troubles are just beginning. His House has three nods, including Outstanding British Film and Outstanding Debut for Weekes, and you can catch it now on Netflix. Christopher Nolan’s time-twisting, head-spinning   was one of the major new cinema releases post-lockdown in 2020, but it hasn’t proved the awards juggernaut some predicted. Still, it gets a nod here for its impressive visual effects, and it’s available now on Amazon Prime. Likewise, Autumn de Wilde’s   (with a screenplay by Eleanor Catton) has only picked up one nomination here, for Best Costume Design. But its charming cast features Anya Taylor-Joy, Johnny Flynn, Josh O’Connor and Bill Nighy, and you can find it now on Amazon Prime. Another Tom Hanks entry - this time an   based on C. S. Forester’s novel The Good Shepherd, about a US Navy commander defending merchant ships under attack by German U-boats. It’s nominated for its sound and visual effects, and is available to watch on Apple TV+ (£4.99 a month)."

When Bond went Blaxploitation: Yaphet Kotto’s problem with Live And Let Die
","
The late actor's role as the Bond franchise's first black villain was revolutionary – a little too revolutionary for some
",Tristram Fane Saunders,"
16 March 2021 • 11:40am
","For  ’s first appearance as   in 1973, MGM went out of their way to make him as unlike his predecessor as possible. This suave new spy drank gin-and-tonics (not vodka martinis), smoked cigars (not cigarettes), and – in a feat zanier than anything ever attempted by Sean Connery – used killer reptiles as stepping stones. In Live and Let Die’s most famous set-piece, 007 runs across the backs of a line of crocodiles. It wasn’t the real 007, but they were certainly real crocs. While scouting for locations in Jamaica’s Montego Bay, the producers had driven past a curious sign: “Trespassers will be eaten”. It marked the entrance to a crocodile farm owned by a man called Ross Kananga. The crew decided to give Kananga a role as Moore’s stunt double for a scene at his ranch, rather than risk a member of their cast or crew to the critters’ snapping jaws. Wearing a pair of crocodile-skin shoes (a joke suggested by Moore), Kananga completed the death-defying dash in just five takes. The producers were so impressed by Kananga that appropriated his name for the film's chief villain, played by the black actor Yaphet Kotto – in another sign that this wasn't Connery's 007, he would be the first black Bond villain. But the role proved to be a mixed blessing for Kotto, who has died at the age of 81. Although Bond was eventually good for his career and led to roles in Alien and Raid on Entebbe, he later complained of feeling sidelined on-set and was all but shut out of the film's publicity campaign. ""The producers did not want to promote me in the film,"" he said in 2007. ""In fact, I found out that Time magazine and Newsweek were interviewing the rest of the cast. I went to [producer] Harry Saltzman and said, 'Why wasn't I included?' 'We were afraid that there's never been a black villain before. We don't want people to think stuff.' So they didn't promote me."" The producers, essentially, feared a backlash if the public found out that their villain was black. The making of the film itself was just as problematic, with not every scene going as smoothly as the crocodile hopping. It took no fewer than 29 takes to film the moment when Bond uses his magnetic watch to unzip a dress worn by buxom Italian agent Miss Caruso (Madeline Smith). This might explain why their love-scene is one of the more stilted encounters in the Bond canon, but the lengthy shoot wasn’t the only mood-killer. According to Smith, Moore’s wife Luisa Mattioli insisted on supervising the scene, keeping a chilly eye on her to make sure there was absolutely no funny business. Moore would hardly have been in the mood, anyway: during the shoot, he was hospitalised with a painful bout of kidney stones. He was put on an a new medication to deal with them, but the pills left him with a woozy head – and bright blue urine. “I was still zonked out and in unfamiliar surroundings, so when I got up for a pee at two in the morning, I opened what I thought was the bathroom door when it was the wardrobe and relieved myself,” he told the Mail. “'The next morning I discovered my mistake when I found my lovely clothes had turned various shades of patchy blue!” Elsewhere, filming was beset by problems. One actor was bitten by a snake, which escaped his grasp and slithered over defenceless actress Jane Seymour (who was tied between two bedposts at the time) before it was recaptured. In filming a thrilling water-chase Moore’s boat veered out of control and crashed through a boathouse wall, twisting his knee and cracking his teeth. “There I was, a fearless 007, hobbling on a cane to my boat and then pretending to be indestructible for the cameras,"" he recalled in his autobiography. “Who says I can't act?” The actor also managed to keep his cool when faced with a trapdoor that looked likely to decapitate anyone who used it. But only after he insisted that the door’s designer John Wardley should test it out first. Wardley remembered the scene in an interview with the Huffington Post’s Mike Peake: “[What] proved to me what a cool guy Roger Moore was, is a scene in a bar called the Fillet of Soul run by the villains. There is a table that disappears into the ground once Bond sits at it. This mechanism was quite a sturdy piece of equipment and the director insisted that the sliding floor should come across rapidly as the table disappears. It whistled across your forehead and slammed shut. We designed this contraption and all in all there was about three tons of steel in it. “The director said to Moore, ‘Whatever you do, you must not flinch’, at which point Moore turned to me and said, ‘I’ll do one take – but I want to see him’, pointing at me, ‘do it first.’ So I did, and it was pretty frightening. He then did it, and he did not bat an eyelid.” Although the risky action sequences and rogue reptiles caused a headache for producers, the real snake in the grass turned out to be the film’s casting. With the film’s action moving between New York's Harlem, Louisiana and the Caribbean, Live and Let Die was the franchise’s attempt to cash in on the burgeoning Blaxploitation genre, following the recent success of Shaft (1971) and Super Fly (1972). It was intended to be a bold departure from previous Bond films, an idea winked at in the script. In one scene, Moore starts to introduce himself with Connery’s catchphrase (“My name is…”) only to be cut off by Kotto's Harlem gangster and master of disguise Mr Big, aka Dr Kananga: “Names is for tombstones, baby.” As well as the franchise’s first major black villain, the film also starred – to the distaste of a few bigoted audience members in America’s Deep South – its first black Bond girl. “As Bond, I make love to Rosie Carver, played by beautiful black actress Gloria Hendry, and Luisa [Mattioli] has learned from certain Louisiana ladies that if there is a scene like that they won’t go to see the picture,” Moore wrote in his 1973 James Bond Diary (now sadly out of print). He continued: “I personally don’t give a damn and it makes me all the more determined to play the scene.” Regardless of Moore’s views, many of the choices made during the production now seem shockingly insensitive. The original script featured a major role for an African-American actress as Bond’s main love interest: Obeah mystic and tarot-card reader Solitaire. At one point Diana Ross was among the stars considered for the part. But the producers got cold feet, recasting the role at the last minute – perhaps over concerns about the worldwide box office. At the time, any films depicting an interracial relationship were still banned in several territories, including Japan and South Africa. “While filming somewhere in New York City or New Orleans, they decided that it was too risky to have a black woman end up with James Bond,” Hendry said in a 2004 interview. “Therefore, the [smaller, supporting] role of Rosie Carver was switched to black, and the role of Solitaire was switched to white. That is where I came in.” The producers didn’t feel it was worth their time to find a realistic stunt double for Hendry, and resorted to the controversial practice of  . For one bedroom scene, “They ended up having a white British gentleman in brown makeup with a dress and an Afro wig,” Hendry has recalled. Yaphet Kotto, meanwhile, was not invited to the premiere and and celebrated the film's release with friends in a Harlem bar. “They were afraid the public would react negatively to a black villain so they didn’t play my character up,” he told the Big Issue in 2015. “That hurt me a lot, man. I went through a lot of goddamn emotional hell because they were afraid people would be angry that a black guy was not being Sidney Poitier. I was the opposite of everything he created.” Earlier, Kotto had claimed the producers essentially ""set me up"" and portrayed him as a rabble-rouser: ""One of the actors raised a clenched fist, saluting me, so I raised my clenched fist, and a photographer swiveled around and said, 'You're a militant SOB' and took my picture and gave that to the producers. I had promised Dr. King – I was with him at a couple of demonstrations – that I would never do anything militant. So they had me pegged wrong."" Although the film’s racial politics can look seriously dated today (not to mention its villain's bizarre, flatulent death scene), Kotto felt that having such a formidable black character in a world-straddling franchise “would open up the doors for others – and it worked"". The actor had some personal experience to prove it: he was later offered the role of Captain Picard in Star Trek, but turned it down. He was less positive about his co-star. ""I have nothing to say about Roger Moore,"" he told an interviewer in 2007. ""He said in his book – I don't know if I read it in there, but one of my secretaries told me – he said, 'Yaphet had a chip on his shoulder.' What is this dude talking about? What is his problem? I mind my business, do my job. If he said that, he had no right to because he doesn't know me that well."" But if any part of the Bond series's muddled foray into Blaxploitation was a success, Kotto has said, it's less due to Roger Moore than to the charismatic Kananga: “a guy who is completely together – almost as together as James Bond himself. He was a hero!”"

Oscars 2021: When are the 93rd Academy Awards and how to watch the ceremony live in the UK
","
Hollywood's big night is going ahead – but it's not quite the Oscars as normal. Here's everything we know so far
",Marianka Swain,"

","This year’s rather unusual film awards season culminates with Oscars in late April. But what can we expect from the 2021 Academy Awards - and how much will Covid change Hollywood’s big night?  The ceremony for the   takes place on April 25, airing live on US TV station ABC at 8pm Eastern Daylight Time (midnight UK time). It’s a delay from its usual February date. Sky Cinema will air the event in full on its sub-channel Sky Cinema Oscars, followed by a highlights reel on Sky One. The Sky coverage will also be streamed online through Now TV. Existing Sky TV customers can sign up Sky Cinema for £11 a month, or you can pay £11.99 a month for Now TV’s Sky Cinema Pass. Although there’s a handy loophole for the latter: you can get a seven-day free trial. The ceremony will be held outdoors in a courtyard at downtown railway hub Union Station in Los Angeles. According to veteran Oscars director Glenn Weiss and first-time producers Jesse Collins, Stacey Sher and   (an apt choice: the director of  ), there will also be some “additional show elements” coming live from the Dolby Theatre – which usually hosts the Oscars ceremony. In a joint statement, the producers stressed that they want the telecast to “look like a movie, not a television show.” So, expect some ambitious elements – perhaps musical performances or comic skits from the Dolby. The Oscars haven’t had a host for the past two years; the last host was  . It looks like there will not be a host in 2021 either, but instead a reliance on multiple awards presenters to keep the show on the road. In the main: yes. The producers are urging nominees to show up at what they call “an intimate, in-person event” - and no Zoom participation is allowed (avoiding the disasters of the  ). Only nominees, their guests and the presenters will be invited to this scaled-down Oscars. Organisers are also enlisting celebrities for video interviews to be taped ahead of time and broadcast during the show. We don’t yet know who the presenters are, although we’ll likely see the usual mix of A-list actors and directors, including winners from last year - like Joaquin Phoenix, Renée Zellwegger, Brad Pitt and Laura Dern.  The producers have said that they are treating the event like an active movie set. That means an on-site Covid safety team administering PCR tests, and lots of rules in place for those attending - presumably involving mask wearing and social distancing.  Fear not: the tearful, rambling, occasionally political and always OTT acceptance speeches are a go. However, the producers have urged winners to “read the room” and “tell a story”, rather than just listing off names, and to bear in mind that organisers are “aiming for a feeling of casual exchange and good humour.” Absolutely. While some awards shows have embraced lockdown fashion (i.e. pyjamas as daywear), the Academy Awards are holding firm. The dress code, per the producers, is “a fusion of Inspirational and Aspirational, which in actual words means formal is totally cool if you want to go there, but casual is really not.” In other words, ditch the hoodie and dust off that tux. Not as such. But there will be a 60-minute, pre-show virtual event from   (who won the Best Original Song Oscar last year for  ), raising money for his AIDS Foundation. Neil Patrick Harris will host, alongside John and David Furnish, with a stripped-back performance from Dua Lipa. The special will be on virtual platform Cisco Webex, streamed in the US on April 25 and elsewhere (including the UK) on April 26. You can purchase tickets via Ticketmaster. Vanity Fair is also going online with a charity event series to benefit the Motion Picture & Television Fund’s Covid relief efforts. Their Cocktail Hour Live will take place April 13-15, offering a mix of interviews, performances, panel discussions and cast reunions. A-listers confirmed include Serena Williams, Michael B Jordan, Gal Gadot, Glenn Close, and   nominee Amanda Seyfried. The awards honour films released between January 1 2000 and February 28 2021. The Academy’s board of governors voted to temporarily allow films that were first released via streaming services or video on demand to be eligible, if they were originally scheduled to have a theatrical release. That means films which haven’t yet been released in cinemas, due to Covid, are still considered. This year’s list of nominees has already made history. There are two women in the Best Director category:   for   and Emerald Fennell for  , with Zhao hotly tipped to win the award - as is Nomadland for Best Picture. There are also nine actors of colour nominated, including the first Asian-American up for Best Actor,  ’s Steven Yeun. We may well see a diverse list of winners, too, with the late   favourite to win a posthumous Best Actor Award for  , and Daniel Kaluuya leading the race for Best Supporting Actor for . Adding to a good haul for the Brits, we may well see Ferrell nab a Best Original Screenplay trophy and/or Sacha Baron Cohen take Best Adapted Screenplay for  , following their Writers Guild Awards wins. Also in the mix are David Fincher’s Mank, which picked up an impressive 10 Oscar nominations; The Father, starring Anthony Hopkins and Olivia Colman, with six nods; Aaron Sorkin’s  , with six; the Riz Ahmed-starring Sound of Metal, also with six; and Best Actress challenges from Andra Day in  , and Vanessa Kirby in  . And might the silly spoof   scoop Best Original Song? Stranger things have happened... Good news: we’ve got a   waiting for you, so you can get up to speed ahead of the ceremony and pick your own winners at home."

Why Dick Van Dyke was the true marvel of WandaVision
","
The 95-year-old's pursuit of perfection has made him a living legend – and cost him dearly, Now he's an unsung hero of the Marvel Universe
",Martin Chilton,"

","“If someone from the UK sees me, they are on me like a pack of wolves,” joked  , who always accepted the mockery over his role in Mary Poppins with good grace, admitting he’d delivered “the most atrocious Cockney accent in the history of cinema”. Even so, the man who played Bert the chimney sweep remains indubitably popular. Paul Bettany, the London-born actor who plays Vision in  , said he drew on the American, one of his “favourite stars”, for inspiration in the hit Disney+ series. “I throw a little bit of Dick Van Dyke in there,” Bettany said of his accent playing the synthetic humanoid. WandaVision, the show based on Marvel Comics characters, has introduced a modern generation to the delights of the 95-year-old actor and singer, whose brilliant sitcom The Dick Van Dyke Show, which ran from 1961 to 1966, was a jewel of comedy writing and acting. The show, along with his contributions to popular films such as Chitty Chitty Bang Bang and Mary Poppins, forged Van Dyke’s reputation as an entertainment giant and one of the most likable stars ever to appear on television. Despite admitting that they had to explain WandaVision to Van Dyke, a man who “did not seem to be too fluent with the Marvel Cinematic Universe,” the show’s director Matt Shakman described his lunch with the veteran star as “one of the best afternoons of my life”. Shakman and Marvel President Kevin Feige picked his brains about his celebrated CBS series, and in turn appointed him as a consultant on WandaVision. “It was an opportunity to talk about how they made The Dick Van Dyke Show, which is one of the greatest television shows ever made. And it still works just as well today as it did back then. It’s a timeless classic,” Shakman told Looper. In the penultimate episode of the debut season of WandaVision, it is revealed that Wanda Maximoff’s Sokovian family were hooked on American sitcoms. We see her watching a clip from her favourite The Dick Van Dyke Show episode, one from 1963 called It May Look Like a Walnut. It had a science-fiction based plotline about body-snatching, tipping a nod to The Twilight Zone. The Dick Van Dyke Show’s creator Carl Reiner had to battle for that unusual episode to be made. “My partners didn’t want to do it,” he recalled. Van Dyke’s character Rob Petrie dreams that he may be the last remaining human, in a world ruled by an alien from the planet Twilo. “I wanted to use pods like they did in Invasion of the Body Snatchers,” Reiner added. “When I couldn’t, I decided to use walnuts. When Rob’s wife Laura [played by  ] comes sliding out of the hall closet on two thousand walnuts, that was worth the price of admission. We later gave those walnuts to charity.” The Dick Van Dyke show won 15 Emmys – three for its star and five for Reiner, who described Van Dyke as “maybe the most talented man I’d ever seen”. Audiences simply fell in love with Van Dyke’s character, the head writer on the fictional Alan Brady Show. Reiner played the egocentric, toupee-wearing Brady. “I had the most fun,” said Van Dyke, describing his time on the show as “the best five years of my life”. Part of this was down to his wonderful comic chemistry with Tyler Moore, and part was because of the quality of the dialogue by Reiner and his team of scriptwriters. When Van Dyke’s first wife Margie visited the set of the sitcom, she told him it didn’t look like he was acting at all. “You’re exactly like you are at home,” she said. Loose-limbed Van Dyke’s gift for slapstick stunts remains impressive. “Here’s a guy who is a physical comedian. ‘How do you make room for that and make it feel justified?’ we asked Dick,” revealed Shakman. “We learned so much from it. He told us about the general rule of thumb, which is, ‘if it can happen in real life, it can happen on the show,’ and I believe in that. Drawing on that experience makes room for as many falls over ottomans as you want.” Shakman was referring to the opening credits, in which Van Dyke falls over an ottoman footstool as he enters his living room, one of the most famous tumbles in television history. Van Dyke, who was born in West Plains, Missouri, on 13 December 1925, was “a Laurel and Hardy nut” when he was growing up, idolising the physical comedy of Laurel. During the making of The Dick Van Dyke Show, he came across Laurel’s listing in the local Californian telephone book and gave him a call out of the blue. He told the English-born comedian that he had imitated his pratfalls from an early age and “stolen from you pretty liberally”. “Yes, I know,” replied Laurel cheerily. The two men became friends, and Van Dyke later delivered a eulogy at Laurel’s funeral. There was plenty of bittersweet comedy in Van Dyke’s own family history. His father Loren was a former minor-league baseball player who ended up eking out a living as a travelling salesman for the Sunshine Cookie Company. He was then always known to friends and family as ‘Cookie’. It seems that Cookie crumbled after he fathered Van Dyke out of wedlock, with a stenographer called Hazel McCord. “Suddenly, the good life, as he knew it, vanished and he got a job as a salesman,” Van Dyke recalled in 2016 of his upbringing in Danville, Illinois. “He hated the work, but always had a shine on his shoes and a smile on his face. Years later, when I saw Death of a Salesman, I was depressed for a month. It was Dad’s story.” Although Van Dyke and his brother Jerry sometimes saw flashes of the witty bon vivant that their relatives remembered from better days, they always recognised the sad, quiet clown beneath the mask. Van Dyke remembered his mother as being far more talkative. “If she had a deficiency, it was absent-mindedness. She once cooked a ham and later found it in my father’s shirt drawer,” he added. Van Dyke, who was certified with a “highly gifted” IQ of 150, began to think of a career in showbusiness after making his mark as a radio announcer – first in high school and later after enlisting with the US Air Force – and was keenly aware of the power of publicity. He was “too broke” to marry his high-school sweetheart Margie Willett, but when a radio station agreed to pay for a honeymoon if they wed live on air, he readily agreed. “So, in 1948, we exchanged our vows in front of a minister and two radio microphones while 15 million people listened,” he explained. After working as a radio DJ, he pursued a career on Broadway. Television producer Sheldon Leonard spotted his potential after seeing him in a production of Bye Bye Birdie, suggesting to Reiner that he cast him in the television show that made him famous. His success brought Hollywood offers. After reprising his stage role of Albert Peterson in a film version of Bye Bye Birdie, he was offered the role of Bert (and the ageing Mr Dawes) in Mary Poppins, one of the most popular musicals of all time. Van Dyke starred opposite the eponymous nanny Julie Andrews. He said he was completely unaware during the shoot that anything was wrong with his Cockney accent, taught to him by a dialogue coach from Ireland. “I was working with an entire English cast and nobody said a word, not Julie Andrews, not anybody said I needed to work on it, so I thought I was alright,” he lamented in 2014. Even so, he was convinced that “something magical was going on,” in Mary Poppins, especially with the songs. Van Dyke grew up steeped in music – his father had played saxophone in a jazz band – and was a keen pianist. He went on to record several of his own albums, including one with the Ray Charles Singers. Van Dyke said he understood why cinema-goers connected with the lyrics, especially the “ridiculous word” supercalifragilisticexpialidocious. He said the catchy tunes Chim Chim Cher-ee, Let’s Go Fly a Kite, A Spoonful of Sugar and Feed the Birds, “didn’t just get under my skin, they became part of me then and never left”. Van Dyke had a well-earned reputation in Hollywood as a perfectionist. During the 1967 film Divorce American Style, he spent three days choreographing a single sequence, in order to perfect the timing of a scene in which he and his screen wife Debbie Reynolds open and slam closet doors, cabinet doors and bathroom doors after a bitter row. The following year, he starred in Chitty Chitty Bang Bang. In his 2011 autobiography My Lucky Life in and Out of Show Business, he reveals that it was a role he “repeatedly turned down”. The casting was random. “Dick Van Dyke was older than me and I was playing his dad,” Lionel Jeffries, who starred as Grandpa Potts, remarked. After a big-money offer secured his participation, Van Dyke quickly regretted his involvement. He fell out with director Ken Hughes, who admitted he was “unenthusiastic” about a film based on Ian Fleming’s children’s book, using  s screenplay. Van Dyke overheard Hughes make a disparaging remark about the size of his nose (“what are we going to do about his hooter?”) and he later upbraided Hughes about his habit of swearing in front of the child actors. “Quite simply, I thought he was wrong for the picture,” wrote Van Dyke. “One day I heard him grouse that he had to rewrite Roald Dahl’s script. Who rewrote Roald Dahl?” Despite all the problems, Van Dyke excelled as Caractacus Pott, the eccentric inventor who creates a magical car. The musical numbers were memorable, including the title song, Hushabye Mountain and Truly Scrumptious. Van Dyke, who had always been a keen dancer, had his work cut out on the ensemble version of Me Ol’ Bamboo, a Morris dancing-based tune devised around composer Richard Sherman’s memories of England, when he used a bamboo walking stick. Van Dyke lost 15 pounds rehearsing that gruelling song over and over. “The bamboo sticks had metal poles inside and we had to jump over them and dance with them,” Van Dyke, who was 41 at the time, said in a TV documentary about the making of the film. “Most of the dancers were 15 years younger than me and it took us 23 takes to get it right. In the last take, I only just make it. This was the hardest dance number I ever did.” Van Dyke remained cheerfully candid about the film’s idiosyncrasies, including the fact that the English rain meant that many of the scenes were filmed in France. “We ran out of sunshine so filmed in the south of France, it’s all vineyards, you can see lots of grapes,” he said with a laugh. He didn’t enjoy driving the famous car, either, which he described as “very hard to handle and almost impossible to turn”. Although film offers continued to pour in, it became increasingly clear to Van Dyke that he had a serious drinking problem, something he had “deluded” himself into thinking he could handle, even after recognising that the drunken scenes he played in Divorce American Style were uncomfortably close to home. He likened his alcoholism to heroin addiction. “I tried to be a good role model to my children, but I was an alcoholic for 25 years, which inevitably impacted on family life,” he said. Margie, who suffered a miscarriage of twins before they had four children, was also struggling with her own problems. “When I pledged to quit and entered a rehab clinic, Margie checked in as I checked out. I thought she’d come to pick me up, but it turned out she was hooked on anti-depressants. I had no idea. What a pair,” he admitted in 2016. Van Dyke acknowledged that his drinking brought “personality changes” and mood swings. “I was in deep trouble, you get suicidal and think you just can’t go on. I had suicidal feelings, it was just terrible. But then suddenly, like a blessing, the drink started not to taste good,” he told The Telegraph that same year. By then, the actor was with his third wife, makeup artist Arlene Silver. After divorcing Margie in 1984, he spent the next 35 years with former actress Michelle Triola (Lee Marvin’s former girlfriend and a plaintiff against him in a famous palimony suit) who died in 2009 from lung cancer. He married Arlene in 2012, and both have talked in gushing terms about their happiness. Van Dyke dubbed their relationship “a second childhood”, while Silver, who is 46 years younger than her husband, called it “a fairytale”. When asked in 2014 what kept him youthful, Van Dyke quipped: “My young wife… she puts me in the fridge.” It is striking just how enthusiastic and joyful Van Dyke has remained, despite the ups and downs of life. In one reflective moment, in a 2011 interview with USA Today, he talked about his sanguine world view. “The only philosophy I have is that there is no such thing as security – not financial, not emotional, not anything. Insecurity is what exists and I think people make the mistake of trying to build security for themselves. If you can just live with that wisdom, of knowing there isn’t any security, that is a way of relaxing and sitting loosely in the saddle of life that’s much better, because you don’t worry,” he said. Although he was honest enough to admit he “gladly said ‘Yes’ to a hodgepodge of TV movies”, Van Dyke will be remembered for a rich legacy of work beyond his hit show and the two movie triumphs. Although certain projects never came to fruition – he wanted to play Stan Laurel in a biopic and King Lear on stage, and made the “stupid” decision to turn down the lead role in The Omen – he earned a Golden Globe nomination for The New Dick Van Dyke Show, a series written and directed by Reiner that ran from 1971 to 1974, about a Phoenix television talk show host. He went on to win a Golden Globe for ‘Outstanding Guest Actor in a Comedy Series’ for a 1989 episode of The Golden Girls. His successful role as a doctor in Diagnosis Murder, which aired from 1993 to 2001, also enabled him to wrangle work for his family. His brother Jerry – who joked that “I’ve been hanging on his coat-tails for 80 years” – son Barry and grandson Shane all appeared in that long-running medical crime drama, prompting Van Dyke to quip that “I took nepotism to its final point.” In his final senior citizen career days, Van Dyke moved into more villainous territory, playing a corrupt policeman in Warren Beatty’s Dick Tracy and a scheming security guard in Ben Stiller’s Night at the Museum. Nonagenarian, Van Dyke continued to keep fit – working out at the gym most days and swimming regularly – and penning, at 90, the book Keep Moving: And Other Tips and Truths About Aging. The actor railed against the way that “ageism has become the last acceptable form of discrimination.” In one poignant interview he reflected on the fact that he had lived so long that “my whole generation has disappeared on me,” reflecting on lost friends such as Paul Newman, Jack Lemmon and his Malibu neighbour and friend Charles Bronson, who always gave Van Dyke a lemon cake for Christmas. Van Dyke took heart in the way he remained revered as a pioneer by modern comedians. When Van Dyke conducted a Q&A at the 2017 Salt Lake Comic Con, Rob Schneider spoke to him from the audience, saying: “You planted the seeds and we have all been stealing from you for 55 years or so.” Schneider, a star of Saturday Night Live, also brought up the old chestnut joke by asking whether it was true that Dick Van Dyke had changed his name from Penis Van Lesbian? “I’ve had to live with that joke for so many years,” replied the 91-year-old amiably. He also showed his lighter side after being awarded the Britannia Award for Excellence in Television at the 2017 BAFTA awards. “They asked whom I would like to present the award, so I sent them a list of a whole load of dead people, including Laurence Olivier,” he joked. Van Dyke, humble and broad-minded, is a man of surprises. His hobbies include creating his own computer animations and singing in a Barbershop Quartet (his group, the Vantastix, once sang ‘The Star-Spangled Banner’ before an LA Lakers basketball game). He is active on Instagram and Twitter and made public his dislike of Donald Trump (“there’s something missing”). He’s also a man with a social conscience, even in his 90s volunteering at the Los Angeles homeless charity The Midnight Mission. “I go down Thanksgiving, Christmas and Easter, and I dance, I sing, I greet people at the door,” he said. Happily, his dancing feet still work, something evident in his cameo role in 2018’s Mary Poppins Returns, in which he played Mr. Dawes Jr. Production designer John Myre said he was concerned because the elderly actor’s dance scene “called for a big leap on to the desk of Colin Firth’s character, followed by a tap-dance break”. Dick Van Dyke told Myre to remove the safety steps that had been constructed. Myre said he executed his moves “flawlessly”. Dick Van Dyke fans had been hoping that there was one last television hurrah, with a guest appearance on the finale of WandaVision. Shakman was coy in January when asked about a possible cameo (“I couldn't possibly say,” he remarked), but speculation intensified when Bettany remarked that “there’s a huge reveal with an actor that I’ve always wanted to work with, and I have some real explosive scenes with him.” Van Dyke sadly didn't appear in the WandaVision finale. But that won't dampen the spirits of one of entertainment’s most upbeat performers. “I’ve had such a life and so much fun,” Van Dyke said recently. “I don’t regret a minute of it. I’ve just had the best time you can imagine.”"

The Wonder Woman that wasn’t: inside George Miller’s unmade Justice League movie
","
Armie Hammer as Batman; an evil Superman; a $250m budget. Why was the pre-Zack Snyder Justice League: Mortal scrapped?
",Anthony Brett,"
18 March 2021 • 4:47pm
","In an alternate dimension, Armie Hammer’s role in Call Me by Your Name would have been a risky departure for an actor best known for playing Batman. Mad Max: Fury Road may never have happened. And Megan Gale would have been a name on everybody’s lips. These were elements of Justice League: Mortal, an early incarnation of the Justice League movie that spectacularly flamed out in 2017 after being botched by Joss Whedon, and has now  . But before both version, Justice League: Mortal was due for a 2009 release under the directorial eye of Mad Max: Fury Road mastermind George Miller. Hollywood projects falling apart over time are nothing new, but Miller’s Justice League very nearly happened. By the time the film had been axed by Warner Bros over issues with its budget, its stars and its script, an array of actors had been cast, costumes had been designed and production was about to begin. It remains one of Hollywood’s most infamous unmade films. Information about the proposed movie has been leaked in anecdotes and concept art here and there over the years, forming a remarkable picture of a slightly muddled - if undeniably intriguing - comic book movie that never came to be. The film’s script, leaked online in 2013 and credited to married writing duo Michele and Kieran Mulroney, depicted Batman as an untrustworthy and vaguely dictatorial crime fighter who creates a surveillance machine known as the Brother Eye, which would monitor the Justice League of America and fellow super-powered civilians. This, surprise-surprise, would fall into the villainous hands of businessman Maxwell Lord, who would hijack the machine and create killer robots to battle the team. Justice League: Mortal somewhat oddly positioned The Flash as its central character, who would later sacrifice his life to save the day in the film’s final face-off. In addition, as Maxwell Lord actor Jay Baruchel told the Happy Sad Confused podcast, Superman would turn evil over the course of the film and battle Wonder Woman. “I turn him into full red-eye Superman,” Baruchel recalled. “And then there’s this big-ass fight between him and Wonder Woman, where he breaks her f------ wrists and s---, and then I die halfway through the movie, and then my consciousness is uploaded into a f------ mainframe and I’m an evil computer.” Production art, prosthetic tests and storyboards have leaked over the years, one by artist Steve Skroce depicting the aforementioned Superman/Wonder Woman fight (though he has since deleted the images), and others depicting Aquaman in costume and Wonder Woman’s home of Themyscira. A  has been in the works for years, and will hopefully see light of day when filmmaker Ryan Unicomb manages to get permission to use characters and images from Warner Bros. This incarnation of Justice League was developed at a particularly hopeful time for DC Comics and Warner Bros, who had achieved success with Batman Begins, the first entry in Christopher Nolan’s acclaimed Batman trilogy, and were about to launch a fresh take on the Superman mythos courtesy of Bryan Singer. In September 2007, inspired by the Mulroney script, Miller had signed on to direct the superhero team-up movie, and quickly began to assemble his cast. Looking back at the various breathless casting reports at the time is like taking a glance at the young Hollywood of 2007 in microcosm. There was Adam Brody, fresh from his role in The OC. Jessica Biel and Mary Elizabeth Winstead were both linked to Wonder Woman; the cast of Friday Night Lights read for numerous roles; and rapper Common auditioned at a time when he was eager to break into acting. One-time big-deals including Shannyn Sossamon, Michael Angarano and Joseph Cross were also accounted for during auditions. According to the Hollywood Reporter, Miller was specifically looking for young actors who would be able to “grow into their roles over the course of several movies.” They were also noticeably less expensive than the ensembles of Batman Begins and Superman Returns. Ultimately cast were Armie Hammer (long before his  ) as Batman, TV actor DJ Cotrona as Superman, Australian model Megan Gale as Wonder Woman, Common as Green Lantern, Brody as The Flash, the late Anton Yelchin as his nephew Wally West, Heroes actor Santiago Cabrera as Aquaman and the lateGeorge Miller regular Hugh Keays-Byrne as the Martian Manhunter. Other roles cast included The Big Sick’s Zoe Kazan as The Flash’s love interest Iris Allen, Stephen Tobolowsky as Alfred Pennyworth, Teresa Palmer as Talia al Ghul and Judd Apatow regular Jay Baruchel as villain Maxwell Lord. As Hammer told Vulture in 2010, Miller’s pre-production work on the film had been extensive. “They had pre-vizzed a lot of the special-effects sequences, and we saw some of the fight sequences without even having filmed them yet.” He continued: “There was a giant room that he had turned into the storyboard room — this huge conference room that had floor-to-ceiling storyboards on the walls — and you’d start at one point and just walk around the entire room and by the time you were done, it was frame-for-frame the entire movie. We saw it on paper and we were going to bring it to life, we just never got the chance.” The actors had also tried on their costumes, with Hammer describing his Batman costume as having been made from incredibly luxury fabrics. “His utility belt was made from the finest Italian leather and highly polished, and the things that would come out of his forearm, they were titanium but wrapped in very fine leather.” He also revealed that his Batman would have been the first to be able to turn his head in his cowl. An impending writer’s strike had rushed the film into production based on just a few drafts of a script, but as work began, Warner Bros reportedly got cold feet. There had long been concerns about a Justice League movie potentially confusing the marketplace, particularly as the trilogy was in full swing. That had been publicly exacerbated months earlier, when Batman star Christian Bale told reporters that he had not been contacted to play the Caped Crusader in the film, and declared that “It’d be better if [Justice League] doesn’t tread on the toes of what our Batman series is doing.” According to the New York Times, the Mulroneys journeyed to Australia in March 2008 to work on the script with Miller, amid concerns that “the screenplay did not quite meet the challenge of introducing a new series without undercutting the old ones.” The delay in production also meant options on the cast lapsed, allowing them to sign up to other work. This wasn’t a pressing concern, however, as they had reportedly bonded with Miller during trips to his Australian home and were all eager to film the movie. But another problem was on the horizon: namely that the film could no longer be shot in Australia. Miller, who has rarely directed films outside of his native country, was counting on a 40 per cent tax rebate from the Australian government, who would help finance the film in exchange for the work the project would bring to the country. At a reported cost of $250 million, Justice League would have been largely unthinkable without state help. Australia’s federal government eventually declared Justice League would not receive the 40% rebate, citing a perceived lack of Australian actors in the main cast (that was despite Gale, Palmer and Keays-Byrne all hailing from Down Under). As a result, Warner Bros suspended production. An outraged Miller told the Sydney Morning Herald: “A once-in-a-lifetime opportunity for the Australian film industry is being frittered away because of very lazy thinking. If that’s going to be the final decision, they’re throwing away hundreds of millions of dollars of investment that the rest of the world is competing for and, much more significantly, highly skilled creative jobs.” In light of the decision, production was moved to Canada, with Warner Bros aiming to start shooting in July 2008 for a summer 2009 release. But July came and went, and on the heels of the enormous critical and commercial success of Christopher Nolan’s The Dark Knight, released that month, Warner Bros and DC decided to regroup. “We’re not off the notion of a Justice League,” president of WB production Jeff Robinov told Variety at the time. “There’s a massive interest and knowledge in the comic book industry and it takes time to sort of catch up and understand the characters and the history, where they’ve intersected with each other and what their worlds are. That’s part of the education that we’re going through.” The senior VP of creative affairs for DC Comics, Gregory Noveck, added: “These are big, iconic characters. So when you make them into a movie, you’d better be shooting for a pretty high standard. You’re not always going to reach it, but you have to be shooting for it. We’re going to make a Justice League movie, whether it’s now or 10 years from now. But we’re not going to do it and Warners is not going to do it until we know it’s right.” By the end of 2008, Justice League was as good as dead, and Miller announced on Australian television that he had left the project. Declaring that he was no longer involved “in any capacity”, he also implied that the low-wattage of the cast was also a factor, claiming that the studio “seems to want bigger stars in their superhero movies now.” In the years that have passed, several cast members have spoken about the project, with a mix of both sadness over what they felt was a missed opportunity, as well as a slight shrug over its eventual demise. “For a long time, I was like, ‘How great that could have been!’” Hammer told Vulture. “[But] as a 31-year-old who’s been through a lot since I was 19, I wouldn’t want to watch a 19-year-old Batman. I’d be like, ‘Who’s this spoiled rich kid who wants to play dress-up?’” “I used to be upset we didn’t get to do it, but everything happens exactly as it’s supposed to,” he continued. “I still have a lot of learning to do about this, and it’s a constant pursuit for me. If I had been that successful right out of the gate, I would have thought I already understood it all. I know that I wouldn’t have turned in a great performance, or even a good performance — it would have just been whatever. So I’m glad.” “It was a great script, and it was a great director,” Adam Brody told HeyUGuys in 2013. “I’m not saying it would have changed the world, but that movie would have worked, I will say that. [It] would have been a nice little movie I think, but they [Warner Brothers] just didn’t want to cross their streams with a whole bunch of Batmans in the universe and all the other reasons they didn’t make it. “I will say that I don’t have any particular affinity for the Flash. I grew up reading comic books, and loving them, and I still have a fondness for them. Although the older I get, the more saturated the marketplace gets, I find the less I care as a whole.” Even Miller has been slightly “meh” on its lack of existence. “It was very faithful to the comics at the time, very DCU,” he told the Word Balloon podcast. “Ultimately I think it’s good that it didn’t come out as there were some parts that were cool that they got right and there were some things that people were going to hate. Some of it was very aimed at kids.” Speaking to Australia’s Channel Nine, Gale had a slightly warmer response: “As long as my son thinks I’m Wonder Woman [I'm fine],” Gale told “If that means I’m ‘super-mum’, I’m fine.” Along with crediting the film for her friendship with Miller, who would later cast her in Mad Max: Fury Road, she also spoke proudly of a photograph she took in costume that was leaked online in 2015. “It was a really lovely surprise, because I hadn’t seen it for seven years. We were just doing costume trials. We just did full dress, costume and hair and wardrobe, and we did a photo shoot. But I’m glad that we got that far into production that we had those photos!” Miller’s departure from Justice League was met with odd celebration by fans, who had taken to slamming the director as “just the guy who did Happy Feet” and mocking his casting choices. The fresh-faced, all-American Hammer, then a complete unknown, had been repeatedly dubbed “Frat-Man”. “Since he was announced as the director of Justice League, I’ve grown to dislike him and his idiotic casting choices,” wrote Alex Billington of First Showing in 2008. “I couldn’t be happier that he’s no longer involved!” In hindsight, such a reaction is slightly embarrassing. On paper, Justice League: Mortal had story issues, while the timing of its intended release and its lack of relationship with the Nolan trilogy indicated a lack of thinking on the part of Warner Bros bosses… something that has been replicated ever since. But Miller would also go on to direct one of the 21st century’s most relentlessly exciting and justifiably heralded blockbusters in the form of Mad Max: Fury Road, and it remains intriguing to imagine what he would have done with the superhero genre. In light of Zack Snyder’s nonsensically grim adaptations and the Joss Whedon snark crudely stuck onto it with scotch tape, it really couldn’t have been much worse. “It was allegorical, like a story of Greek Gods almost,” Cotrona told Slashfilm in 2015. “He was doing things with the Superman character and Batman character, and all the iconic favourites, that’s never been done before. Watch Fury Road and you can only imagine what he would do with those iconic characters.”"

","It’s been six years since Kay Mellor’s soapy drama about lottery winners was last on the box – inexplicably, since it’s an amiable ensemble piece that makes a change from detective dramas. The fourth series has the same basic premise as before – five Yorkshire-based folk, this time kennel employees about to be made gig workers, pick the winning numbers. Mellor sets the scene prior to their win: the twentysomethings are all in financial and emotional straits that will provide grist to the drama mill; one character is secretly pregnant, another fearful of a relative’s imminent release from prison. Episode one focuses on Keeley (Katherine Rose Morley), whose gambling addiction has resulted in debt collectors banging on the door. Neil Morrissey and Gaynor Faye play the newsagents who redeem the ticket – middle-aged sweethearts whose imminent wedding plans are derailed. The familiar Mellor ingredients are there – ordinary northerners with empty pockets and big hearts wrestling with crushed dreams. We’re rooting for them, especially when it transpires that there’s a problem for the youngsters in collecting their winnings, a twist that provides narrative drive and levity. A winner.  The return of Fred Sirieix’s culinary TV tour sees him escorted by Nadiya Hussain around her favourite Yorkshire eateries. Sampling fondant fancies at Bettys Tea Café Rooms is a jammy gig for the pair, and their gentle bickering over the etiquette of dunking makes it work as entertainment. The brilliance of this series lies in its bleak, believable rendering of real-life detective work. It raises our admiration immeasurably for the Manchester police wading through CCTV footage and chivvying along witnesses in a bid to crack a shocking case. It turns out that American Joe Exotic (aka the Tiger King) isn’t the only one keeping dangerous wild animals in his backyard. In this two-part documentary, Ross Kemp explores how easy it is in Britain to keep wild cats at home. Visiting, among others, show jumper Reece Oliver and his two pet lions in Nottinghamshire, Kemp’s incredulity and distaste are evident. Hard on the heels of the previous series, adventurer Ben Fogle embarks on another round of home visits to off-gridders. Setting down his rucksack in Ullapool in the Highlands, he mucks in with Iona and Julien, who drive cattle and produce their own hydroelectricity. The shameful rise in anti-Semitism is just one reason why this sympathetic series feels apposite. Several British Jews explain the importance of their faith as we follow them to milestone ceremonies, including the bar mitzvah of Ethan, who movingly uses the occasion to memorialise a Holocaust victim who didn’t live to have his. It’s followed by Being Hindu, in which cameras follow a Tamil wedding. Irish playwright Colm Tóibín’s 2019 one-woman play, performed with coiled energy by Lisa Dwan, is the flip side of Sophocles’s Antigone. We hear her story through the words of her sister, Ismene, who explores her own guilt at being a survivor.   ★★★☆☆ A breezy and enjoyable comedy from Peter Hedges (About a Boy). Steve Carell plays Dan, a schlumpy, lovable newspaper columnist who writes about parenting but proves inept at bringing up his children on his own. Then he falls for Marie (Juliette Binoche), only to discover that she’s dating his brother. It’s undoubtedly predictable and saccharine, but Hedges directs with a sure hand and Carell is a charmingly crumpled everyman.   ★★★☆☆ This low-key and rather dark comedy, starring Alec Guinness, was written and co-produced by JB Priestley and directed by Henry Cass. Informed that he has a short time to live, underachieving salesman George (Guinness) finds that his resolution to live his remaining life to the full and take risks brings him more advantages than just a good time. The irony is laid on thick, but Guinness is masterful as a man filled with a sudden thirst for life.  ★★★☆☆    Rooney Mara plays the titular unsung apostle with alabaster poise who opts for a life on the road with Jesus Christ (Joaquin Phoenix) in this austere biblical drama from Lion director Garth Davis. It’s solemn, strange and oh-so-tastefully done with Etsy-friendly shawls and rugged coastlines, but its thought-provoking rather than overwhelmingly powerful. Still, Phoenix plays Jesus with a guru-like intensity, and the ensemble cast are superb.  Those who feel a little Gyles Brandreth goes a long way may want to steer clear of Channel 5 for the next few Wednesdays, as he explores the lives and works of Thomas Hardy, Charles Dickens and the Brontë sisters. That said, he’s on relatively restrained form for this opening episode, reining in the archness and not dressing up any more than, say, Lucy Worsley might on a similar assignment to visit key locations in Jane Austen’s life and talk to the experts. Along the way he encounters the scribblings of a teenage Jane that showcase her imagination already at work, splicing her name with a fictional person called Fitzwilliam. He takes the waters in Bath just as she did while accompanying her brother in search of a cure for his gout, and joins the Austentatious improv gang for a skit, alongside more serious excursions into her political views and private life. None of it will come as news to hardened Janeites (a term popularised by confirmed fan Rudyard Kipling), but that’s hardly the point. Bursting with clips from the many Austen adaptations of recent years, this is literature done Channel 5 style, and none the worse for that.  It doesn’t seem so long ago that Fifa made the bizarre and contentious decision to award the 2022 World Cup to Qatar – a desert nation with little footballing history, but lots of oil money. England’s qualification campaign will likely come down to two matches against a talented Poland side, with the first at Wembley this Wednesday. First, on Sunday, England travel to Tirana to face Albania in what should be a more straightforward affair (ITV, 4.10pm). Meanwhile, Wales host Czech Republic in Cardiff on Tuesday and, on Wednesday, Scotland play Faroe Islands at Hampden Park (both Sky Main Event, 7.45pm) and Northern Ireland take on Bulgaria in Belfast. Also on Wednesday, Chelsea play Wolfsburg (BT Sport, 1pm) and Manchester City take on Barcelona (4pm) in the Women’s Champions League quarter-final second legs. City have it all to do after losing the first leg 3-0; Chelsea are 2-1 up.  This thorough two-parter focuses on how gardens reflect personalities and the ways in which the magpie instincts of famous horticulturalists and designers have been turned towards creating a particularly English take on the garden. The series begins with the era from the Romans to the Renaissance, and the history is brought up to date tomorrow evening. Rob Rinder joins the regulars in this strange but compelling series trying to pick the real homeowner (in this case, “Michael”) apart from the impostors. What conclusions can they draw when one Michael can’t remember anything about their life, or when another essays an oddly familiar chat-up line? Mutinous mutterings swell in volume as further men die on the long trek to safety, while no less a public figure than Charles Dickens (Tristan Teller) is enlisted to help in raising finance back in London for a rescue expedition as the irresistibly bleak and evocative thriller approaches its conclusion. Always “Matthew” to his mother, Janice, TV presenter Matt Baker, and his family, rushed from Hertfordshire to the family farm in the Durham Dales when Janice was trampled by a herd of sheep. With Janice recuperating and her husband Mike unable to run the farm alone, the Bakers are forced to make big decisions about the future. It’s all captured by this engagingly intimate series which, while light and entertaining for the most part, has serious things to say about ageing and filial relations. Part of the BBC’s ongoing festival of theatre recast for television and radio, David Ireland’s play unflinchingly examines the life of one Belfast cleaner (Abigail McGibbon), who confronts ghosts of her past raised by her new and intense relationship with a younger man. The last instalment of this fine documentary series finds doubts afflicting some of the hopeful parents, while others find navigating the unique relationship between intended and surrogate parents particularly testing as the due dates approach. A tough, but heartening watch.   ★★★★★ From its F-bomb-laced opening to its tear-jerking use of WH Auden’s Funeral Blues, Richard Curtis’s romcom is a stone-cold British classic. (It’s still the highest grossing British release of all time.) It made a star of Hugh Grant – he was the 72nd actor to audition for the role – as the lovelorn, floppy-haired rogue Charles who falls in love with an American (Andie MacDowell) at his best friend’s wedding. Glorious.  ★★★☆☆ Ambitious young director Craig Roberts (he made his first film aged only 24) bites off a little more than he can chew in this indie-inflected take on paranoid schizophrenia. Sally Hawkins is Jane, a woman whose grasp on reality is cracked by meds, her horrid family and imaginary terrors. But despite the talented cast, Roberts can’t decide whether he’s making a comedy or a serious drama about mental illness. In the end, it’s neither.  ★★★★★ Ang Lee’s pitch-perfect adaptation of the Jane Austen novel brought Kate Winslet fame and Emma Thompson a deserved Oscar. They play sisters Marianne and Elinor, both in want of a husband but attracted to rather different ways of getting one. The famous scene in which shy Elinor (Thompson) receives the proposal she has longed for is a masterclass in restraint. Also starring Alan Rickman and Hugh Grant. It’s not just Harry and Meghan who are embracing the media these days. Lady Pamela Hicks, daughter of Lord Mountbatten, cousin of the Duke of Edinburgh, bridesmaid, companion and lifelong friend of the Queen, has been in revelatory mode recently, too, in a podcast made by her daughter, India. Never known to let a royal-related tell-all escape its grip, ITV has picked up this one-off filmed at home in Oxfordshire, in which Lady Pamela, now 91, and India, 53, look back over an exceptionally glamorous life lived right at the top of the tree. But those looking for scandal will have to look elsewhere. Unlike Harry and Meghan, there’s no word of criticism of the royals or any little idiosyncrasies they might have. Quite the opposite. “She’s an amazing person,” Lady Pamela says of the Queen. “There’s such inner strength there and she’s remained like that throughout her life.” Inevitably odd scraps leak out, relating to the Princess Royal’s hand-me-downs or the Queen’s celebrated thrift, but otherwise this is an unadulterated love letter to the Queen from one of her closest friends. While the Palace might prefer this approach, you do miss Oprah’s pizzazz.  We all have stories connected to particular pieces of clothing, items that instantly summon up the past. This new eight-parter based on a bestselling book by Emily Spivack opens a multitude of wardrobe doors and bottom drawers to see how deeply clothes are bound up with identity, creativity and memory. The show featuring business start-ups pitching for investment from a panel of entrepreneurial titans gets its 18th series off to a feelgood start with an unusually high number of successes. Not least the (traditionally triumphant) closing pitch, in which a couple with strong links to the NHS negotiate one of the most successful “equity climbdowns” in Dragons’ Den history.   Another round of heart-melting canine adoption stories as more rescue dogs are matched with their new forever families, including a pug inclined to fainting fits, a lurcher meant to mend a broken heart, and a lively Jack Russell with enough energy to follow his adventurous new owners anywhere – even on wheels. Should you not be content with your own, or even the UK’s, experience of Covid-19, this absorbing new documentary series tells the story of the pandemic from a global perspective through the experiences – and very widely varying attitudes – of people from all around the world, beginning in Wuhan. Events of the recent past make for grim but compelling viewing. If lockdown’s left you missing your April Fools japes, there’s plenty of pranking in tonight’s helping of comical challenges. Among the highlights are Lee Mack attempting a hammer throw and Sarah Kendall endeavouring to make sitting down more memorable. Greg Davies and Alex Horne present. Two decades since their hit sitcom Home Improvement came to an end, Tim Allen (known to millions as the voice of Buzz Lightyear) and Richard Karn are reunited for this small scale but entertaining challenge in which competitors test their DIY skills by trying to build or repair anything demanded of them by the hosts, from a do-it-yourself jacuzzi to a barbecue that doubles as a bicycle. It’s larky, Boy’s Own fun.  ★★★☆☆ Kevin Macdonald’s film (nominated for five Baftas) is a legal thriller of sorts, but one with a timeline that sets about defeating suspense: a 14-year incarceration without trial. It’s based on Mohamedou Ould Salahi’s 2015 memoir Guantánamo Diary, but retold without much friction. What lifts it to a major degree is Tahar Rahim’s performance as Salahi and Jodie Foster as his formidable defence attorney Nancy Hollander (a recent Golden Globe win). ★★★★★ Carol Reed confirmed his position as one of Britain’s greatest directors with this film noir, which oozes atmosphere and crackles with suspense. American writer Holly Martin (Joseph Cotten) is offered a new job in Vienna by his friend Harry (Orson Welles). But upon his arrival, Holly is told that Harry is dead. Refusing to accept this, he begins his own investigation. Graham Greene adapted his own novella for the screenplay. ★★★★★ This darkly brilliant farce by satirist Chris Morris, which finds the funny side of terrorism, was met with controversy on its release, and shows no signs of losing its bite. It charts the journey of five hapless British would-be jihadists, including family man Omar (Riz Ahmed), as they plan a mass suicide attack. What ensues is a comedy of errors, as they all are distracted on their road to paradise. Rubber dinghy rapids, anyone?  For many of us, what we look forward to most once the pandemic is over is the opportunity to travel again. Following on from its wanderlust-inducing series on great railway journeys, Channel 5 provides inspiration aplenty in this new six-part series, narrated by perennial favourite Bill Nighy, giving us a taste of some of the finest inland waterways on the planet. Among the rivers are the Danube, Mississippi and our very own River Spey in Scotland. But we begin with a trip down one of North America’s mightiest waterways, the Niagara River which runs along the border between Ontario in Canada and New York state in the US, before plunging headlong into the gorge beneath the world-famous Niagara Falls. Connecting two of the Great Lakes (Ontario and Erie), it is a short but tremendously powerful river, which over the millennia has carved out some stunning riverside landscapes. The journey begins with a short hop on a US Coast Guard launch out of Buffalo, upriver through the Chippawa Channel towards the Falls, then onwards through dizzying gorges, whirlpools and rapids before finishing with a tour of Canada’s breathtaking wine country. You’ll be longing to book plane tickets.  A unique recital of Easter sacred music featuring each of the Tenebrae vocal ensemble’s 20 singers filmed and recorded separately in isolation, under the direction of Nigel Short. Among the highlights in a selection of works by JS Bach, Lobo, Purcell, Parry and Allegri. In a chock-full Easter special Kate Quilton gets to grips with chocolate’s basic ingredient at a cocoa plantation in Ghana, and Matt Tebbutt visits a confectionery factory to uncover the mysteries of mint fondant and the secret of what makes white chocolate white. One of the most intelligently joy-giving TV series to come out of the pandemic draws its second run to a close, and we can only hope for more in the coming year. Painting up a storm for Grayson and Philippa Perry tonight are illusionist Derren Brown and Liverpudlian artist Chila Kumari Singh Burman, plus more viewers’ submissions are chosen for the exhibition. The whole run of this series has been a vibrant delight for seasoned paint-splashers and newbies alike.  Lots of ideas here for those keen to get on with gardening again now that the chill of winter is gone. At Longmeadow, Monty Don has advice on mulching and planting out sweet peas for summer colour, Carol Klein revels in the floral displays at RHS Rosemoor and there’s a look at how far daffodil enthusiasts will go to produce the perfect bloom. The second episode in this enlightening series recalls the first major setback of Churchill’s political career when, in 1915, his ill-conceived plan to shorten the First World War via a major offensive on the heavily defended Gallipoli Peninsula resulted in shocking casualties, defeat and his sacking as First Lord of the Admiralty. This nostalgic music series reaches 1984 and the days of Tina Turner’s What’s Love Got to Do with It (did you know it started off as a Bucks Fizz song?), Frankie Goes to Hollywood’s Relax, and the hits of Wham!  ★★★★☆☆ This refreshingly serious biblical epic takes on the modest task of dramatising the life of Jesus, from birth and ministry to crucifixion and resurrection. Jeffrey Hunter plays the son of God, Siobhán McKenna is his mother and Rip Torn plays Judas. It begins with the Roman invasion of Judea by Pompey in 65BC and the appointment of King Herod; the rest, as they say, is history. Nicholas Ray (Rebel Without a Cause) directs with stately authority.  ★★★★★ It’s hard to overestimate the significance of Robert Wise’s all-singing, all-dancing tale of Nazis, nuns and scenic mountainscapes – it’s one of the most iconic film musicals of all time. Julie Andrews is a nun-turned-governess for the von Trapp family, and their grumpy patriarch (Christopher Plummer). Gradually, she wins his heart – and the children’s love – through the power of song. Plummer, famously, hated his role.   ★★★★★    Wash Westmoreland’s intimate historical biopic sees Keira Knightley play Colette, a woman who marries a rakish “literary entrepreneur”, Willy (Dominic West). When he publishes one of her stories under his name to instant success, it lights a wildfire story of literary and sexual emancipation. The biographical details are bruisingly observed, and Knightley shoots daggers from behind her cut-glass cheekbones. Sarah Hughes ( ), Gerard O’Donovan ( ), Vicki Power ( ) and Gabriel Tate ( ) "

Why Nicolas Cage’s Superman Lives had to die
","
It had Tim Burton directing, a script by Kevin Smith, and a producer who didn't want Superman to fly. What could possibly go wrong?
",Tom Fordy,"
21 March 2021 • 12:00pm
","In the summer of 1996, Kevin Smith met producer  to talk about the script for Superman Lives – the long-in-development, ultimately-abandoned blockbuster that was, at different stages, set to be written by Smith, directed by Tim Burton, and star . At Peters’ Los Angeles home – which Smith likened to Wayne Manor (Peters had also produced the 1989 version of Batman) – he told Smith there were three rules which must be followed for this updated  story. “One, I don’t want to see him in that suit,” said Peters (according to Smith) about the most iconic threads in pop culture history. “Two, I don’t want to see him fly. And three, he’s got to fight a giant spider in the third act…” Twenty-five years on, that giant spider is like the monstrous manifestation of Superman’s battle with Hollywood – a battle to not only put Superman on the big screen, but to get Superman right. It’s a battle which has left a trail of abandoned, unmade films behind him like a discarded cape. The latest of these almost-were films,   – AKA “The Snyder Cut” – has finally become a reality, following a   in support of Snyder’s vision for the DC ensemble. But Snyder’s retooled, four-hour Justice League is puny compared to the legend of Superman Lives, embodied by the image Nic Cage in leaked test shots – donning a revamped suit, a shoulder length wig, with a sleeker ‘S’ logo emblazoned across the chest, and no red pants – like the biggest “What if?” and “WTF?” in cinema history. Indeed, Superman Lives may be the greatest blockbuster never made – the mightiest, most notorious movie to die a painful, drawn-out death in the fires of Development Hell. So notorious is Superman Lives that a documentary was released in 2015, directed by the late Jon Schnepp – The Death of Superman Lives: What Happened? Even now, in the age of the 23-movie Marvel Universe, Superman Lives looks like a massively ambitious movie extravaganza at the dawn of digital effects. The project, which underwent various scripts and phases, was inspired by the early 1990s “Death of Superman” comic book storyline, in which DC killed off and resurrected the Man of Steel – a crafty ploy to boost flagging comic sales.  The film would have included the alien Brainiac – a top-tier villain in the comics – baldy arch-nemesis Lex Luthor, and Doomsday, the monster who killed Superman. The concept of the unfinished, troubled, or cobbled-together Superman film goes back further than Justice League or Superman Lives. Before “The Snyder Cut” there was the “Donner Cut” – a much-hyped alternative version of 1980’s Superman II. Richard Donner – original director of the Christopher Reeve-starring Superman films – was fired mid-production and replaced by Richard Lester. But Donner returned to piece together his version of Superman II for a 2006 DVD. There were other almost-made Christopher Reeve stories. An early outline for 1983’s Superman III, written by producer Ilya Salkind, features Supergirl, Brainiac, and inter-dimensional trickster Mr Mxyzptlk. It ends with Superman and Brainiac jousting on horseback and Mr Mxyzptlk turning the world into a giant puzzle – vastly different but no less daft than the Richard Pryor vehicle that Superman III eventually became. For Superman IV: The Quest for Peace, the producers licensed the rights to  , purveyors of stack ‘em high, make ‘em cheap films, the most notorious of which are Masters of the Universe and, erm, Superman IV: The Quest for Peace.  The film was hit with budget problems. As the legend goes, around 45 minutes has never been seen. One fight sequence featured Casualty’s Clive Mantle as a simple-minded super villain – a prototype of the finished film’s “Nuclear Man”. Canon announced Superman V, but planned to make the film with the unused Superman IV footage. With the character back in the hands of father-son producers Alexander and Ilya Salkind, another version of Superman V was pitched, which would have sensibly ignored Superman III and IV and featured Brainiac (him again) shrinking Metropolis into a bottle. The next figure to take on the Man of Steel was Jon Peters, who picked up the rights from the Salkinds – apparently swiping the option from under Warner Bros’s nose. Peters is a former hairdresser who has a rep for having a violent temper, shouting down subordinates, and crowbarring terrible ideas into movies. Peters originally got into the business through his relationship with Barbara Streisand. “He used to be Barbara Streisand’s hairdresser and then one day he became a producer,” said Kevin Smith in 2002. “Because in Hollywood you just kinda fail upwards.” An entire book – Hit & Run by Nancy Griffin and Kim Masters – was written about how Peters and his partner Peter Gruber (“his soulless soul mate”) landed top jobs at Sony and ran the studio into the ground with excess and bluster. At first, Peters' project was titled “Superman Reborn” – “Might as well have said ‘Superman remarketed for a new generation,’” Smith told Jon Schnepp – and went through two script drafts. The first, by Jonathan Lemkin, would have seen Superman killed and literally reborn, with his spirit attaching to Lois Lane’s still-gestating baby; the second draft, by Gregory Poirier (a former porn movie writer who used the pseudonym Hugh Jorgan) was a campy send-up in which Clark Kent goes to a psychiatrist to unload the problems of being Superman. At the time – following the success of Clerks and with Chasing Amy about to be released – Kevin Smith was the sharpest voice in nerd cinema and then-King of the Comic Book Geeks. He convinced executives to let him write Superman. Kevin Smith recalled Peters reaching for some solidarity, claiming that they’d make Superman a success because “we’re from the streets”. Smith – from suburban, middle class New Jersey – doubted the street credentials of the perfectly coiffured producer. But it’s a self-image that Peters has maintained. “I’ve been in 500 fights,” Peters told Jon Schnepp. As an amusing footnote, Peters was also set to produce Under Siege 2, but disagreements almost led to a punch-up with Steve Seagal. After writing his first draft, Kevin Smith was summoned by Peters – this time, bizarrely, to read him out the screenplay aloud. Smith recalled Peters laying back on his sofa and creating a frame with his hands director-style, making an imaginary screen in which he could visualise the action as it was being told to him. In The Death of Superman Lives, Peters denies telling Smith that Superman shouldn’t wear the suit or fly (though other writers recalled similar instructions). But Peters readily admits demanding the giant spider battle. Smith placated Peters and dubbed his deadly arachnid a “Thanagarian Snare Beast”. Across two drafts, Smith had to include more of Peters’ ideas: a polar bear action scene at the Fortress of Solitude, and a gay sidekick robot for Brainiac. Peters also wanted Sean Penn for Superman because he “had the eyes of a killer”. Smith admitted that his Superman Lives script was pure fan fiction. “It was one of those jobs where you’re just like f––– it, write your dream movie,” he told Jon Schnepp. The script was packed with references and characters from the DC Comics-verse. Batman gives a eulogy at Superman’s funeral. In the pre-Marvel movie era, that kind of crossover cameo would have melted the brain of the average fan. Smith recommended Tim Burton as director, not realising that he was effectively firing himself. Burton didn’t like Smith’s script and brought in Wesley Strick to rewrite the script. New elements included the merging of Lex Luthor and Brainiac – creating a double-faced monster named Lexiac – and the robot companion “K” for Superman. Burton was a likely choice. With 1989’s  he had reinvented the Dark Knight and made Warner Bros half a billion dollars. In 1996, Mars Attacks had been a box office dud in the US, but Burton was still a curious, fantastical visionary in mainstream cinema – not yet saddled with the likes of his Planet of the Apes “reimagining”. Burton had little reverence for the Superman mythology and latched onto the idea of the genial, wholesome Superman/Clark Kent as the ultimate outsider – a literal alien. Twenty-five years later, it’s fascinating to imagine how the brighter, primary-coloured world of Superman would have melded with Burton’s twisted, gothic style.   Burton was wary of Jon Peters, with whom he clashed and kept at arms length on Batman. Wesley Strick recalled that Burton filmed Batman in England partly to get away from Peters. “Like force of nature,” said Burton about the producer. “It’s like trying to control the weather.” But it was Peters who suggested the Superman Lives project’s real masterstroke – Nicolas Cage as the Man of Steel. Cage is a lifelong fan (he named his son Kal-El, after Supes’ Kryptonian birth name) and offered to play Luthor or Brainiac before signing up as Superman. Cage seems like a leftfield choice – especially now, after 20-odd years of him wavering between mainstream films, oddball indies, and straight-to-DVD tat – but in 1996 he won an Academy Award, and in the middle of his Holy Trinity of Nineties action: The Rock, Face/Off and Con Air. Cage was planning to go full Nic Cage as Superman. “I was going to turn that character upside down,” Cage later said. Other cast members were lined up: the now-banished Kevin Spacey as Lex Luthor – a role he played in 2006’s Superman Returns; Chris Rock as Daily Planet photographer Jimmy Olsen; and Christopher Walken as Brainiac. As recalled by Jake Rossen in his book Superman vs. Hollywood, there were some doubts among Warner Bros execs about Cage, and doubters from the fan community hit the geek-centric message boards – a precursor to the rabid internet negativity that surrounds modern franchises. Most controversial – and indicative of how Burton intended to change Superman – was the outfit. In the script, the robot companion attaches to the now-dead Superman like a suit, changing as he regenerates and evolves, until finally Superman dons an updated version of his threads. Several suits were made: silicone biomechanical suits, muscle suits, vacuum-formed suits with laser-powered fibre optic lights – with a distinct lack of red pants. The Superman Lives story is best remembered for that test image of Cage in the upgraded suit, but other test images – with Cage in the more traditional Superman gear – are undeniably tantalising. Burton had a small army of concept artists and effects wizards working on pre-production. As seen in The Death of Superman Lives doc, the design work is vast and otherworldly: monsters, robots, spaceships, bizarre-looking Kryptonians. Jake Rossen noted that merchandise tie-ins were a huge factor – characters and gadgets were geared towards potential toys. The design team experienced the full force of Jon Peters, who would storm in, usually with an entourage of women and children, and show off his new jujitsu moves. “Sometimes he’d get somebody in a headlock,” Burton told Jon Schnepp. “One time he kissed me full on the lips. Now which is better? I don’t know. I think I might have preferred the headlock, or a kick to the face.” Peters explained his macho posturing as “creating an energy of an action hero.” He had more bonkers ideas: he wanted Superman to use his cape like a deadly boomerang, and Brainiac to drive through space in a giant skull. Burton recalled pressure to include Superman having a kung fu fight against a band of ninjas, which sounds decidedly like the “Biff!” and “Ka-Pow!” cartoon violence from the Sixties Batman series Sets were built across soundstages at a cost of $20 million, and Pittsburgh was scouted as a stand-in for Metropolis. But Warner Bros executives were nervous about the script, and yet another writer was brought in – this time Dan Gilroy, writer and director of 2014 Oscar-winner Nightcrawler. Warner Bros had suffered a string of duds – money-losers such as Kevin Costner’s The Postman, and the franchise-zapping embarrassment of Batman & Robin. The studio estimated that Superman Lives would cost $140 million – though Jon Peters reckoned closer to $300 million with marketing and other expenses – which forced Gilroy to scale down the action. Finally, in late 1998, Warner Bros killed Superman Lives. In the aftermath, there were other attempts to resurrect the Last Son of Krypton: a Batman vs. Superman project by Wolfgang Petersen, which at one stage was tipped to star Jude Law as Superman and Colin Farrell as Batman; and a JJ Abrams-written project, dubbed Superman: FlyBy, which had McG and  attached as directors at different times. In one version of the script, Lex Luthor was a CIA Agent and secret Kryptonian, and Superman’s suit came out of a can. Warner Bros finally re-launched the Man of Steel with Bryan Singer’s Superman Returns in 2006 – not a reinvention, but a sentimental nod to the Christopher Reeve films. Singer reportedly kept a photo of Nic Cage as Superman to hand, and pulled it out as a shield against criticism – proof of what was narrowly avoided. To my mind Superman Returns is an underappreciated gem, though not everyone agrees. “Remember the first movie where ‘You’ll believe a man can fly?’” said Kevin Smith in a live show. “This movie’s going to be 'You won’t believe how f–––––– boring this man is.'” A Returns sequel was sort-of planned but scrapped. In 2007, Warner Bros developed then binned  , which would have been directed by Mad Max maestro George Miller and starred DJ Cotrona as Superman and Armie Hammer as Batman. Jon Peters didn’t get his reinvented version of Superman, but he did get his giant spider. A giant mechanical spider would show up for the climactic battle of the Peters-produced Wild Wild West, which bombed in 1999 – the year after Superman Lives was canceled. Speaking at the Toronto Film festival in 2017, Nicolas Cage gave his take on Superman Lives. “I would offer that the movie that Tim and I would have made, in your imagination, is more powerful than any of the Superman movies,” he said. “I didn’t even have to make the movie and we all know what that movie would have been in your imagination. That is the Superman. That is the movie. Even though you never saw it — it is the Superman.” The reputation of Superman Lives is all the more powerful for never being made. It’s hard to imagine the film that Burton envisioned, at the dawn of digital effects, standing the test of time. Attempts to reinvent, redefine, or make Superman “real” – the worst offender being one that actually made it to the big screen: Zack Snyder's dreadful Man of Steel – have missed the point of the character.  Superman should be the purest, most straightforward to adapt of all the superheroes, which is why the original Christopher Reeve-starring Superman has never been bettered – by any superhero film. It remains the template, with the most heart and ingenuity. As proved by Man of Steel, which took a cue from Superman Lives and ditched the red undies, Superman needs the pants."

The night The Strokes brought rock back from the dead
","
Twenty years ago, The Strokes played London and changed music overnight. But it soon became lonely at the top
",Andrew Perry,"
17 February 2021 • 5:00pm
","On a chilly mid-February night in 2001, rock music was reborn in a grimy pub venue in North London – or so it was often later declared. In the days following the  ’ first headline show in the capital, the swaggering young quintet from New York City were quickly heralded by the UK’s music press as alt-cultural messiahs – ineffably cool saviours of the male-dominated guitar-slinging tradition which, at that point, dated back 40 years to the birth of The Beatles, and beyond. In some ways, it really does feel like two decades ago, or more. Even pre-pandemic, the notion of ‘saving rock’ had become absurdly antiquated – indeed, a vain hope for many. After a wave of rock ‘n’ roll revivalism which followed the Strokes’ explosive ‘arrival’ that night, the musical mainstream has been dominated by rap, R&B and synth-pop for a good 15 years now, with rock bands largely consigned to cult status. Equally, the forum for making such proclamations has all but expired. With the NME, who effectively propelled the band to stardom in a matter of several weeks, these days relegated to a marginal online presence, and influential magazines like Q and Melody Maker now defunct, information and commentary are dispensed by any number of specialist websites, none of which pack the near-imperial authority of Britain’s infamous ‘inkies’ in the 1980s and 1990s. On that legendary night at the Monarch, the writing was actually already on the wall. Through the 1990s, I’d worked on an indie magazine called Select, which by the decade’s end was struggling, as the boom years of   gave way to a rather lifeless period where tastes fragmented towards UK garage and rap-rockers like Limp Bizkit, while core artists Radiohead felt the need to reinvent themselves on 2000’s Kid A as techno weirdos.  Focus-group investigations into Select’s future painted a bleak picture. Our retort was: now is like the boring time in the mid-1970s which ultimately fuelled punk rock; kids aged 16 to 24 will always need guitar music, it’s a market requirement – the cavalry will be here any minute. Our reasoning fell on deaf ears, and the publishers wound up Select in mid-December 2000. So, my own personal mood was understandably along the lines of ‘told you so’, when, barely six weeks later, I was eking a few quid as the Monarch’s house DJ for the night, and there, clear as day, the cavalry galloped onstage. The Strokes, with their crumpled suit jackets, artfully dishevelled hair and droopy-lidded insouciance, were the post-millennial shot of energy that rock fans of all ages – and both genders – were crying out for. As well as impossibly photogenic, their music plainly shunned pop’s increasingly overwrought digitization, keying into a crunchy New York lineage forever known as “the Velvets to the Voidoids”, with their louche, puppy-cheeked singer, Julian Casablancas, suavely poised as a new Lou Reed. During their handful of songs that night, I remember one noted female critic barrelling over to whisper in my ear, “They sound like Gene!”, referring to a critically unfavoured late-Britpop ensemble. Overall, though, the packed crowd of 200 scenesters were exultant, as if indeed the Second Coming was upon us.  Their big tune at that stage was Last Nite, from their doubled A-sided debut single, a solid-gold party-starter about romantic miscommunication, whose tensile riffing – loosely nicked from American Girl by Tom Petty & The Heartbreakers – came as a mighty breath of fresh air after all of Radiohead’s hand-wringing quest for hi-tech originality. The flipside, The Modern Age, told of another clueless couple who amusingly can’t work out how to act in each other’s company – unpretentious, light-hearted rock ‘n’ roll fare – while another immediate stand-out, New York City Cops, railed at their local constabulary (“they’re not too smart!”) with a smirking sense of self-awareness at the goofiness of making such a statement. By the autumn, they’d drop the song from their set, out of deference to the NYPD’s many heroes amid the horror of 9/11, but through those preceding months the Strokes essentially redefined rock ‘n’ roll as a young and carefree artform. When I met them on their return to London in June ’01, they were dizzy from the outright hysteria that greeted them at the previous night’s sell-out 1,000-capacity show at Heaven. Gathered around a rooftop pub table in Islington, they had little interest in serious analysis of their work, as they nattered in scarcely veiled terms about their respective conquests back at the hotel after the show. “Every place you go,” Casablancas informed me, between gales of giggling, “there are always cool people and less cool people. I can’t remember where we were on tour, but I was taking a shower, and Albert [Hammond Jr, guitarist] was doing phoner interviews. Afterwards he walked in saying, ‘I just don’t like these very serious – British –  !’ He’d obviously got off the phone with someone going, ‘What is your message for the children of the UK?’ He’s like, ‘I dunno, I’m just a kid myself!’” The Strokes were, indeed, a bunch of hearty youths suddenly having the time of their lives. As we talked, they fought amongst themselves over two vast boxes of free clothes. Barely into their early 20s, they distractedly detailed how they’d had their first rehearsal together in October 1998, played their first gig in September 1999, and after the Monarch show, had performed a sell-out show back home, where, said Casablancas, news of their Transatlantic success had piqued fresh interest.  “The roar was so intense,” he mistily recalled, “it almost made you fall over. But instead of falling over, it just sort of feeds you. It’s like your brain’s getting electrocuted”. The five of them were very conscious that they’d landed in the right place at the right time. They knew that their provenance from New York was a selling point here, where the “I Heart NY” T-shirt was becoming ubiquitous as a generation of young adults capitalised on the proliferation of affordable flights to explore the Big Apple. “It’s a lot like London, except it’s open much later,” reasoned their lead guitarist, Nick Valensi. “Everything is at your disposal 24 hours a day, every day of the year, whereas here, man – by midnight you can’t get anything to eat!” Nevertheless, Valensi would soon wind up dating London society starlet Amanda de Cadenet, and it was eminently detectable that day that the Strokes themselves were anything but street urchins. It would soon emerge that Casablancas, whose father founded the Elite Model agency, had met the other members at various private schools between uptown Manhattan and Rolle, Switzerland.  Consequently, their hunger for success would be called into question further into their career when activity became sporadic, and from the off they approached being in a band with a savvy bordering on world-weariness. Valensi beamingly informed me that their first album was going to be called *Is This It?, “because the hype machine is in motion, and there have already been so many magazine articles. By the time people actually get to buy the record and put it into their CD player, they’re already thinking, ‘Is this it?’” They were, however, passionate and instinctive about what they were doing. “We all listen to different stuff,” revealed Valensi, “but there’s some things we all agree on, like The Velvet Underground, Bob Marley,  …and Spinal Tap.   “I don’t like talking about the lyrics,” added Casablancas, “because it’s like explaining a dream. It might f**k up someone’s imagination of it. With good lyrics sometimes, you read them and they rhyme and they make sense and they’re pretty, but then you hear them in the song, and you’re like, ‘Wow!’ The most simple line that even a kid could understand sometimes has the deepest meaning in that context. That’s the power that music has.”  Another hurricane of laughter swept the pub table as the singer’s band mates barracked him for the absurdity of that statement, and he responded by crooning, “That’s the pow-uuurrrgh! of meeew-ziiiiiiic!” with pseudo-Bon Jovi bluster. It was very clear that the Strokes, puerile banter and all, had the magic formula of a perfect rock ‘n’ roll band for their time. Rush-released on 30 July 2001 by the newly revived UK indie label, Rough Trade, Is This It? hit Number Two over here, and enjoyed massive slow-burning success Stateside, eventually amassing global sales of over two million copies. With that, came a deluge of guitar-toting competition from the likes of the White Stripes, the Hives and countless other combos, and a world of pressure, which their dream team simply wasn’t built to withstand. In the NME, their every step was documented and scrutinized: when you’re fielding banner headlines that read, ‘Strokes Write New Song!’, every time you take a creative breath, it must become mighty hard to remain productive. They suffered something of a success freak-out, and were slow to deliver their second outing, 2003’s Room On Fire, which came across as muffled and chorus-shy. When I met them again another couple of years later around 2005’s First Impressions Of Earth, they seemed to have grown up way more than the four years it had been since our initial meeting. They also lamented how all their friends they used to party with at gigs had been priced out of Manhattan by spiralling rents, migrating to the Boroughs.  “It gets kinda lonely up here,” Hammond mused, as he gazed out from their penthouse over the famous skyline. In the interim also, of course, the internet boom had exponentially multiplied the level of scrutiny that anyone in public life had to endure, a process which obviously only intensified through to the ensuing years. Though as early-twentysomethings they were laconic and self-aware, their initial eruption onto the scene can only be reappraised now as days of relative innocence, culturally and musically, never to be repeated. Indeed, what price a game-changing group of rock messiahs in 2021? That cyclical narrative of rock rebirth followed by relative slump seemed to fade out of prevalence around the turn of the 2010’s, as the incoming younger generation discovered their own culture around social media, and accompanying air-brushed sounds characterized by funereal beats and whingeing auto-tuned rappers. Whether that screen-dominated recipe will feel relevant in what has already optimistically been daubed the Roaring Twenties, remains to be seen. In a nutshell, let’s hope not."

It's a Sin... to steal: how Pet Shop Boys’ hit single ignited the music industry's strangest feud
","
What do Cat Stevens' Wild World and Pet Shop Boys' It's a Sin have in common? Everything, mogul Jonathan King alleged, before mayhem ensued
",James Hall,"

",", Channel 4’s drama about a group of gay friends in the Eighties as the  appears on the horizon, has been receiving rave reviews for its humanity, heart and humour. But the   song after which the hit show is named can lay claim to its own dramatic story, albeit one that is more bonkers than poignant. It’s a Sin was the second UK number one single for the deadpan synth-pop duo, often dubbed the Gilbert and George of pop. The song topped the charts for three weeks in July 1987. A gloriously over-the-top track that featured a NASA countdown, claps of thunder, choral chanting and quotes from the Latin Mass, It’s a Sin marked the peak of what Pet Shop Boys’ singer Neil Tennant would memorably call the band’s “imperial phase”. It also had one of the most catchy synth hooks of the decade. But in what must rank as one of the most bizarre incidents in the colourful world of 1980s pop, the song saw the Pet Shop Boys accused of plagiarism by the (since disgraced) columnist and music mogul Jonathan King. King very publicly claimed that It’s a Sin had stolen its melody from Cat Stevens’ 1970 hit Wild World. Not content with baselessly accusing the band, King recorded his own version of Wild World in the high-energy style of It’s a Sin and released it as a single. Its sleeve ruthlessly parodied the cover of the Pet Shop Boys’ accompanying album Actually. The band sued King for libel, but not before Stevens himself got involved. In a decade known for excess and silliness, few stories were as downright odd as this. “There are a lot of very strange episodes in the wonderful world of pop, but I do remember this,” recalls Barry McIlheney, who was editor of Smash Hits at the time. “The Pet Shop Boys were flying high. The two records didn’t sound particularly alike to me. If you’re going to claim that It’s a Sin is based on Wild World then I don’t know where you begin with a lot of others.” In the summer of 1987 the Pet Shop Boys were on a roll. Their debut album, Please, had been a commercial success the previous year and had spawned their first number one single, West End Girls. It’s a Sin was the first single from the follow-up studio album, Actually. Speaking to Smash Hits (a magazine where he coincidentally used to work) in August 1987, Tennant seemed genuinely surprised at It’s a Sin’s chart success. “I didn’t expect It’s a Sin to get to number one. We always expect our records to be huge, disastrous flops. So I was thrilled to pieces. Two number ones – it’s a proper thing. Have one number one and you’re a one-hit wonder. But have two…,” the singer said. Just as the Pet Shop Boys were enjoying this first flush of fame as copper-bottomed “proper” pop stars, King sought to dislodge their crown. Jonathan King was at the time a famously outspoken character in the British music world. (He was jailed in 2001 for child sex offences). He’d been a singer himself and had seen success with a song called Everyone’s Gone to the Moon in 1965. He’d then become a producer, discovering Genesis, and founded his own record label, UK Records. By the mid-1980s, King had become a well-known broadcaster and media commentator with a regular pop column in The Sun newspaper. And it was to The Sun’s four million readers that King made his claims about the Pet Shop Boys’ alleged plagiarism. “When It’s a Sin went to number one Jonathan King wrote about it in his column in The Sun, suggesting they had committed an act of theft from Cat Stevens and that they should by punished for it,” recalled Chris Heath in his 1990 Pet Shop Boys’ biography, Literally. Other newspapers picked up the allegation, with one journalist contacting Stevens­ – who by then had converted to the Muslim faith and changed his name to Yusuf Islam – for a comment. The singer told the reporter that he wasn’t bothered. But when King repeated the plagiarism claim on the radio, Tennant and bandmate Chris Lowe instigated defamation proceedings. Recalling the events in his diary, Tennant wrote: “One of the most ancient clichés of the music business is ‘Where there’s a hit, there’s a writ’. In 1987 Jonathan King announced on the radio and in his column in The Sun that It’s a Sin was copied from Cat Stevens’ Wild World. We ended up starting to sue King for libel.” It would be reasonable to assume that anyone making a plagiarism claim would have piped down once legal proceedings had been initiated and after the writer of the song alleged to have been copied had shrugged the issue off. Not King. He doubled down. In a hubristic attempt to support his claims, King recorded a single of Wild World to It’s a Sin’s arrangement, down to the choral chants, the thunder clap, the pulsating disco beat and the synth hook. King’s opening vocal lines of ‘Now that I’ve lost everything to you / You say you wanna start something new’ were delivered in a staccato style that mimicked Tennant’s ‘When I look back upon my life / It’s always with a sense of shame.’ As King approached the chorus, he mashed-up the two songs he was conflating. ‘It’s a / It’s a / It’s a / It’s a Wild World,’ he sang. Things got stranger in the spoken-word breakdown (the bit in the original that begins ‘Father forgive me’). King changed the words to: ‘Stevens forgive them / They don’t know what they’re doing / So now they are suing.’ He goes on to make what appears to be sexually suggestive remark about the pair. He didn’t stop here. The sleeve of King’s Wild World single featured a pastiche of Tennant and Lowe on the cover of Actually. On the real album, the pair were famously pictured sitting shoulder-to-shoulder in tuxedos looking bored. King’s sleeve used computer trickery to sit him and Stevens next to each other in tuxedos in precisely the same position. The song title was subheaded: ‘Actually, It’s a sin – to steal.’ Just to make sure that his message wasn’t lost, King’s B-side was a medley of the Chiffons’ He’s So Fine with George Harrison’s My Sweet Lord. Back in 1976, Harrison’s song was found by a US judge to have borrowed from The Chiffons’ song when he wrote his own. The ex-Beatle paid damages to the song’s copyright holder. King’s point was as subtle as a sledgehammer. But it didn’t work. The single bombed. Far more importantly, though, repeating the allegations on an actual record did nothing to help King’s case. Listening today, the songs don’t really match. “If anything it weakened his case,” wrote Heath. McIlheney’s recollection of the episode no doubt mirrored the thoughts of many people in the pop world. “I am sure that at the time we would have been very much on Neil’s side. Partly because of his relationship with Smash Hits, partly because the Pet Shop Boys were a fantastic act and partly because Jonathan King would have been regarded with suspicion,” he says. The case took a twist when Islam himself offered to intervene on behalf of the Pet Shop Boys. Tennant recalls: “Yusuf Islam wrote us a very charming letter offering to mediate at one point.” I approached the Pet Shop Boys’ camp, asking for further details of this letter but to no avail. Yet ultimately the Wild World writer’s help wasn’t needed. King settled out of court. At the band’s request he made a donation to the Jefferiss Research Foundation, which researched sexual health and sexually transmitted infections. In diaries published online a few years ago, Tennant likened the case to when guitarist Joe Satriani claimed that Coldplay had copied their song Viva La Vida from a track of his called If I Could Fly. (The case was dismissed by a US judge but it is not known if whether an out-of-court settlement of any kind was made). Tennant noted that Islam had remarked in an interview that the Coldplay song also sounded like one of his from the 1970s. “We hadn’t stolen It’s a Sin from Wild World and I don’t imagine that Chris Martin of Coldplay has copied his song from either Satriani or Stevens. It is possible to write a song based on a strong, logical chord change with a melody line that follows the chord change and so come up with something new that can coincidentally sound like another song which you may never have heard,” Tennant wrote. “For years we used to perform a medley of It’s a Sin and I Will Survive just because the chord changes were so similar.” McIlheney says that the mid-to-late Eighties were a “golden era” for British pop. The “frenetic and relentless” scene was bursting with stars, from stalwarts like the Pet Shop Boys and George Michael to emerging boy bands Bros and Brother Beyond to singers from Stock Aitken Waterman’s ‘Hit Factory’ such as Rick Astley, Mel and Kim, and Kylie Minogue. The industry was awash with money and huge egos. It is perhaps unsurprising, then, that things like the It’s a Sin/ Wild World episode should emerge from the melee. The biggest testament to the greatness of the Pet Shop Boys’ song is that it still sounds like a classic 34 years on, whereas the King controversy is largely a forgotten footnote. And yet, we know that the daft cover version lives on in at least one record collection. According to the Pet Shop Boys’ biographer Heath, Chris Lowe bought a copy of King’s record “because he liked it”. Now that really is a sin."

Why Daft Punk put on the robot masks: ‘It would not be enjoyable for humanity to see our features’
","
The publicity-shy, now disbanded French duo used Hollywood special effects and NDAs to hide their faces. But what's under the helmets?

","In the final scene of Daft Punk’s 2006 arthouse movie Electroma, a robot refracts sunlight through a broken glass and sets itself ablaze. It walks burning into the night and the credits roll.  Daft Punk revisited Electroma this week as the French electro duo released a video announcing their split after 28 years. Two robots – representing band members Thomas Bangalter and Guy-Manuel de Homem-Christo – wander in the desert. Eventually they pause. One manipulates a device in their companion’s back. A countdown begins to bleep. The robot steps away and self-destructs. Music swirls in. It’s Touch, a melancholic mid-tempo workout from their 2013 album Random Access Memories.  It would require a heart of metal not to experience a twinge watching Daft Punk bow out. Yet it feels telling that the sequence with which they chose to exit is from earlier in the film, before the second robot goes up on smoke. Apparently a robot setting itself on fire is not a metaphor with which Daft Punk wished to engage as they exited the stage. They could give up on being pop stars. But they could not entirely walk away from being artificial people. At the end of the farewell clip, after all, one robot endures.  Pop stars hiding their identity behind a persona is nothing new. David Bowie did it with . And by the early Eighties Kraftwerk – Daft Punk’s teutonic precursors – had carried their “Man Machine” concept to the logical next step by behaving in a robot-like fashion in public (and, so the rumours went, in private too). More recently, groups such as London music collective Sault have arrived cloaked in mystery. Who are they, really? Nobody knows.  Daft Punk, though, took the conceit to extremes in that they appeared as invested in concealing their identity as they did in the idea of pop stars conjuring with alternative personas. Having first donned robot masks in the run-up to the 2001 album, Discovery, they seemed not so much fascinated with the idea of playing robot as in keeping their real appearances under wraps. This in part felt like a misjudgement regarding their degree of fame. Yes, hits such as Da Funk and Around The World had catapulted Daft Punk into the charts. But this was Chemical Brothers/Crystal Method level of celebrity – not Britney Spears besieged at the hair dressers. Even if the whole world knew what they looked like it’s quite possible they could have stomped around Paris or their adopted home of Los Angeles uninterrupted. On the scale of famous people you are likely to bump into in Hollywood, a French house duo was way down there.  Still, it hadn’t taken Bangalter and de Homem-Christo long to work out they weren’t keen on having their images plastered everywhere. When their 1997 debut, Homework, became a smash they took evasive action. They would wear bin-bags over their heads and plastic masks that blurred their features. Or else turn their backs on interviewers. Posing for the front of Mixmag that year they sported devil masks.  Nobody cared enough to be caught up in the drama of what they did or didn’t really look like. In part because their music was so sublime it eclipsed the two very humdrum men behind it. But also because of dance music’s culture of anonymity. The duos making up Orbital, Chemical Brothers and Leftfield all looked interchangeably like your older brother or possibly your dad. Few fans were especially invested in these musicians as celebrities in the first place. The whole point of techno is that it was extraordinary music created by ordinary people.  Daft Punk’s robot masks came later, debuting in a 2001 Face magazine photoshoot in Los Angeles. Initially the new look was received as an ironic commentary – in one memorable shot the two robots larked with members of a nudist colony.  “They wanted to portray a day in the life of Daft Punk,"" Luis Sanchis, the photographer behind the shoot told Creativeboom recently. “I came up with some of the scenarios, like the one with the people naked. That shot was actually taken in the Los Angeles house they were staying in at the time. We hired people from a real nudist colony, and as I was preparing the lights they came in – and all of a sudden, they were naked!” The masks were more than props. Working with Hollywood special effects designers and inspired by the robot Gort from The Day The Earth Stood Still, Daft Punk spent a fortune on the helmets and appeared to have poured as much creative energy into them as into their music. Collaborators were required to sign non-disclosure agreements. This was to prevent fans getting their hands on the mask blueprints. When copycats helmets started to circulate, Daft Punk were pleased to discover the measurements were slightly off – “the proportions are really hard to get right just by looking at pictures,” said Bangalter. Initially the helmets had featured “brown wigs”. At the last minute, on the way to that fateful nudist colony shoot, the duo had yanked out the hair extensions. Later versions would come with air-conditioning and sophisticated communications systems. Another set was designed specifically for media appearances: they were shinier and photographed better.  Yet in 2001 the masks were regarded as merely one component of Daft Punk’s playful new image. Indeed, the real focus was on their shapeshifting sound, which had progressed from floor-filling electronica to a sort of fantasy r’n b – influenced by house music but equally by movie scores and the Gallic-Japanese aesthetic of cartoons such as Ulysses 31, with its incredible theme by Denny Crockett and Ike Egan.  If Daft Punk were obsessed with the idea of themselves as robots, the public would be reeled in only when the duo embarked their first major world tour in 2006. Here, their anonymity was part of the fun as they bopped in their gleaming chrome robo-domes from inside an LED pyramid.  One rumour at the time was that Daft Punk had stayed at home and dispatched lackeys to do the gigs. This was a delicious conceit – and one better than Kraftwerk, who had publicly speculated that a day might come when they could put up their feet and send robots out to tour for them. Suddenly the robots made sense. Techno artists have been consistently underwhelming to watch live. In the nineties, seeing Paul Oakenfold or Carl Cox noodling on stage in their baggy t-shirts always broke the spell slightly. But electronic music played by a duo of shiny-headed robots – that was a spectacle that could sweep you away.  “We’re not performers, we’re not models – it would not be enjoyable for humanity to see our features,” de Homem-Christo told Rolling Stone in 2013, “but the robots are exciting to people.” This was one of several interviews they gave promoting Random Access Memories. That record was a conscious move away from electronica towards a warmer retro-pop. And yet most of the media coverage around the LP focused on their appearance – specifically, how ordinary they looked.  “De Homem-Christo, 39, has a wide face, delicate features, stubbled cheeks and long brown hair,” said Rolling Stone, as if describing a rare geological phenomenon rather than an electronic musician in early middle age. “Bangalter, 38, is tall, slightly rumpled, bearded, hair thinning, handsome in a cinema-studies-professor kind of way—he’s funny, good with eye contact, palpably eager to make himself understood,” added a GQ profile around the same time.  Stubbled cheeks, thinning hair – it was all so unremarkable. Indeed, had the pair not invested so thoroughly in the mystery of their appearance it’s a certainty that nobody would have cared. When last did anyone wonder what the members of The Chainsmokers looks like?  Still, with Daft Punk creating such a fuss about their “secret” identities it was inevitable someone would take a peek at their inner circuitry. And so images began to circulate of the pals in their off-duty duds. “Has Daft Punk been unmasked?” went a Vanity Fair story in 2014 – the same year they accepted their Album of the Year Grammy in white-tuxedo robot suits.  “Back in June, electronic duo the Knocks posted a photo on their Facebook page that appeared to show the French Daft Punk-ers—Guy-Manuel de Homem-Christo and Thomas Bangalter—unmasked and playing champagne beer pong in the Sony offices, to boot,” continued the piece. “The picture was promptly removed from Facebook, the Knocks were banished from the music world entirely… and the Internet suddenly had what seemed to be a pretty good idea of what these dudes looked like.” This was by way of unveiling a new snap purporting to be of the pair at LAX. airport in Los Angeles. “One appears to be wearing a blue Texas Rangers hat,” said Vanity Fair. “The other may be wearing a trucker hat.”  These and other photos doing the rounds did not quite rock the world of pop. It turned out Daft Punk – two middle-aged French musicians – looked exactly as expected. Like two middle-aged French musicians.  Today, as fans process the duo’s break-up, they will experience a deluge of conflicting emotions. Gratitude for the wonderful music, regret Daft Punk did not have at least one more classic recording in them. But one thing nobody cares about is what these partners in escapist electronica look like in real life. If anything this overplayed mystery served as an unhelpful reminder that Daft Punk were as invested in marketing and hype as any other pop stars – that they were human after all. "

The dark side of George Formby, a ‘dirty little Northern would-be Casanova’
","
Behind the smile and the ukulele, the ever-popular entertainer – who died 60 years ago this week – was a serial womaniser with a lurid past
",Martin Chilton,"

"," still holds the record as Britain’s youngest professional jockey, making his debut at Lingfield Park in 1915, when he was just 10. For the remainder of the First World War, he raced in Ireland. His father invested in a prize horse called Philander for his son to ride. It would turn out to be a strangely prescient name: Formby kept his lecherous private life secret from a public who made him Britain’s most adored showbusiness star of the era. Formby, who raced under his birth name George Hoy Booth, quit racing after his 45-year-father died of pulmonary tuberculosis in February 1921, shortly after collapsing during a pantomime performance in Newcastle. The teenage Formby quickly decided to follow in his late father’s vaudevillian footsteps, copying parts of his act and adding his own skits as a  entertainer who sang minstrel songs and told jokes about parrots. His huge public popularity came later, when he finally invented his own popular persona as the cheeky ukulele-playing ‘Lancashire Toreador’. Now, 60 years after Formby’s death, it is hard to overstate the level of celebrity the singer-songwriter from Wigan achieved in the mid-20th century. His most famous record, Leaning On a Lamp-post, sold 150,000 copies in just over a fortnight in 1937. The public just could not get enough of him. Formby made 20 films between 1934 and 1946, when he was British cinema’s leading attraction. The contract he signed with Columbia Pictures in 1941 made him higher-paid than Humphrey Bogart, Errol Flynn and  . “He used to get about £35,000 a film – by modern standards that’s about £1,500,000. He was big time,” said lifelong fan Frank Skinner. The major turning point in his early career came in September 1924, when he married “Lancashire lass” Beryl Ingham, a tenacious clog-dancing champion – a skill that had a poignancy, given that Formby hated the anti-Northern nickname ‘Cloggy’ he’d been saddled with as a youngster by Epsom stable boys. She was four years older than Formby and exerted a controlling influence from the start. Formby later described their tumultuous, largely sexless marriage, as a “living hell”. Although she guided his career expertly, astutely directing him to build his act around his ukulele performances, even though he could only play in one key and was unable to read music, she was deeply unpopular on the circuit. Actress Irene Handl called Beryl “a nasty, spiteful, twisted, conniving piece of work”, while Betty Driver, who acted with Formby as a teenager and went on to find fame as a barmaid in Coronation Street, described her as “a monstrous woman”. Beryl shaped his stage image as the good-natured, gormless northerner, always happy to play the clown. He even approved a line in a film describing him as having “a face like a horse and a row of teeth like a graveyard”, and made his buck-toothed grinning shtick his selling point. On screen, his awkwardness around young women became a Formby specialty; his moments of rising panic in any romantic scenario usually punctuated by a yelped cry of his catchphrase, “Ooooh, Mother!”. People loved his squeaky-clean image as much as his squeaky voice. Actor Timothy Spall, who recreated Formby in his 2016 film Stanley, A Man of Variety, is among those who identified a disturbing hidden quality that Formby shared with other great entertainers of his era, including Max Wall and Noël Coward. “Beneath the appearance of cosy fun and jollity,” remarked Spall, “there was something sinister about their affability.” Although Beryl kept a lid on the darker parts of the Formby story, some of the elements, including her own affairs with young actors, came to light in David Bret’s 1999 biography George Formby: A Troubled Genius, the most explicit of the five biographies of Formby. “Beryl had her young men; he had his leading ladies,” said the author in an interview. Bret’s book sparked outrage among the legions of the entertainer’s fans – who call themselves Formbyites – especially diehard members of The George Formby Society, which was founded in the aftermath of the entertainer’s death in 1961. In July 1999, in an editorial in The George Formby Newsletter, the society reacted angrily to the salacious biography, admitting it could be “very damaging” to the society’s image. “Bret’s controversial book condemns George as a womanising drug addict who had leanings toward homosexuals and sympathy towards Hitler. Beryl was classed as a drunkard, a bag and a cow who had a string of affairs,” the editorial said. To add insult to injury, the society reported that Bret had dismissed their members as a bunch “who walk round wielding Zimmer frames and ukuleles”. As well as highlighting old family skeletons – including the story that Formby’s grandmother had been a sex worker in Ashton-under-Lyne and that his father George Formby Snr was a bigamist – Bret revealed the extent of Formby’s womanising with dancers and chorus girls, describing how Beryl flew into drunken rages when she heard about Formby’s philandering. When Formby had an affair with Kay Walsh in 1937, on the set of Keep Fit, Beryl tried to have the young actress removed from the production. When director Anthony Kimmins refused, Formby’s wife went to producer Basil Dean and asked him to have Walsh made look less appealing on screen, fitted out in dowdy frocks and given an unflattering haircut. Walsh, who married director David Lean three years later, apparently fell for Formby’s “charming flirtation”. Although the public believed in the image of ‘Good old George’, his seedy reputation among the acting fraternity was well known. “He screwed like a tiger until dawn,” Bret said in 1999. “Whenever we did a film with him, it would go round the girls’ grapevine: ‘He’ll make passes at you.’ He couldn’t resist trying to make it with all his leading ladies,” said Phyllis Calvert, Formby’s co-star in the 1940 film Let George Do It. Florence Desmond, who was Formby’s leading lady in the mid-1930’s films No Limit and Keep Your Seats, Please, even branded Formby “a dirty little man” and a “dirty little Northern would-be Casanova”.   was a fan of Formby – he chose his song Auntie Maggie’s Remedy as one of his Desert Island Discs choices – and the jazz singer was told by a friend of his actress sister Andrée that it was common knowledge on the northern theatre circuit that Formby would try to seduce dance girls by saying “‘Eee, I’m crazy about you” before offering them, with a wink, the chance to “play with my ukulele”. Sarah Gregory, star of Zip Goes a Million, said Formby used inappropriate physical contact during filming. Formby’s behaviour would have attracted #MeToo publicity in the modern era, but at the time actresses could not risk exposing such a powerful star. The 21-year-old Googie Withers, 14 years younger than Formby when they made Trouble Brewing in 1939, recalled years later that Formby took advantage of a scene in which they fell into a vat of beer to touch her up. “Because we were in water, my skirt had ridden up. He had his hand on my bare thigh and he kept it there and started to kiss me… Beryl was in on it like a flash screaming ‘cut, cut!’” It seems that many of Formby’s female co-stars were obliged to be part of the weird psychodrama of the Formby marriage. Formby’s sexual harassment usually occurred as part of a game of evading the hawk eye of Beryl. Perhaps the strangest of all Formby’s adulterous liaisons was with a chanteuse who went by the stage name of Yana, an affair that began in June 1960, when Formby was top-of-the-bill in a revue at the Queen’s Theatre in Blackpool. Formby was 56 and Yana was 29 at the time. Although Yana’s name hinted at an exotic background, the singer was in fact called Pamela Guard, a former hairdresser’s assistant from Billericay in Essex. She was famous enough to merit inclusion in the 1998 Daily Telegraph Third Book of Obituaries: Entertainers, which described her as “blatantly lesbian”. Formby, it seems, was unaware of her bisexuality, even though she was also living with an American actress at the time. Their affair, which came when Beryl’s alcoholism had started spiralling out of control as she battled leukaemia, was apparently torrid. It prompted a memorably lurid exchange in Bret’s stage play Our George: The George Formby Story: A Play in 2 Acts, during a scene in which Yana is helping Formby get out of his Mr Wu Chinese costume, after one of their shows in Blackpool. “George, would you like to stick it between my t__s again?” Brett has Yana ask Formby. It’s a far cry from Formby’s innocent movie naïveté displays. Bret, who has written biographies of Joan Crawford, Maurice Chevalier and Morrissey, also angered Formby fans with other revelations. Before he became a writer, Bret worked as an NHS administrator in Yorkshire, where he gained access to Formby’s medical records. Among the information he divulged in the book was highly personal detail about the singer’s time in a psychiatric hospital in York, where he was treated for depression and “morphine addiction”. Another controversy in the book concerned the time in 1944 Formby was supposedly investigated by the Home Office’s Dance Music Policy Committee over sympathies to Hitler, a period Formby referred to as “a nightmare”. There were claims that his song Swim Little Fish supposedly mocked the effort against the German U-boats, which were at the time sinking British convoys in the Atlantic. The investigation was rumoured to have been instigated by a jealous actor. In any case, the pro-Hitler charge seems ludicrously far-fetched. Formby was held in high regard by the government and his devotion to the war effort seems clear. He worked as a dispatch rider for the Home Guard and went on numerous overseas tours to entertain British troops, always reminding them that “it’s wonderful to be British”. In addition, the dream sequence in his movie Let George Do It, in which he descends from a balloon in the middle of a Nazi rally to punch Adolf Hitler in the face, was judged in a survey from The Mass Observation Project to have been “the biggest morale-booster of the Second World War.” It’s highly likely that Formby would not have been able to explain himself adroitly in a nuanced argument about lyrics. He was deeply self-conscious about having left school at the age of seven and never having learned to read or write properly. His lack of intellect was sometimes cruelly mocked by his fellow actors. Desmond said of Formby that “the man’s as thick as two very short planks”, while actress Pat Kirkwood, described him as “a cretinous little creature”, adding that “if you tried to converse with him, you’d find there was no one at home”. Although Formby had his detractors, he also had his high-profile fans. And none more elevated than Queen Elizabeth. The Queen’s parents were both Formby fans. He sang before King George VI at the 1937 Royal Variety Performance, and the king sent him a letter saying his family had been “convulsed with laughter” at Formby’s 1938 film It’s in the Air. He was later invited to give a private show at Windsor, which was watched by the young future monarch and her sister Princess Margaret. In 2003, for his book about the Queen, Gyles Brandreth interviewed Deborah Bean, Her Majesty’s long-serving Correspondence Secretary. “During our conversation Mrs Bean revealed to me that the Queen had once told her that she loved the songs of George Formby, knew all of them, could sing them – and frequently did.” There were even reports that she once asked to be president of the George Formby Appreciation Society, although no corroboration of this exists. In 2018, at a special Royal Albert Hall concert to celebrate the Queen’s 92nd birthday, the monarch was particularly delighted when Skinner, Harry Hill and Ed Balls joined members of The George Formby Society to deliver a version of When I’m Cleaning Windows, the Peeping Tom-style song about a man who spies on women undressing. The song was once banned as “not fit to be broadcast” by BBC chairman Lord Reith, who dismissed it as “a disgusting little ditty”. A lot of Formby’s songs were innuendo-filled, including You Can't Keep a Growing Lad Down, With My Little Ukulele in My Hand and With My Little Stick of Blackpool Rock, which was also banned by the BBC for its smutty double-entendres. My Little Snapshot Album contained risqué lines for 1938:  Formby was a witty songwriter – Our Sergeant Major is a fine example of war-time satire – and he attracted other influential fans too, including comedian Peter Sellers, who could do an uncanny impression of the Lancashire singer. Sellers praised Formby as “a terrific performer” and the ukulele man’s songs have been performed by Bill Haley, Richard Thompson and Lonnie Donegan.  was also a fan – paying tribute by including Formby’s iconic line “it’s turned out nice again” in his song Free as A Bird – while fellow Beatle  was such a devotee that he bought the gold-plated banjolele ukulele that Formby used in live performances. Beryl is often the butt of a story that claimed she limited Formby to a weekly allowance of five-shillings of pocket money in their early days, but once he made it big, he spent a fortune on cars and houses. Formby bought more than a hundred luxury cars in his most successful years, including 26 Rolls-Royces with personalised number plates. Then there were the properties. In the early 1950s, Formby bought a lavish 24-room mansion at Foxrock, outside Dublin, telling a reporter who spotted him in the estate agent office that “I’m sick to death of the taxman robbing me of 90 per cent of my earnings.” Some of his fortune came from lucrative foreign tours, including an eventful one in 1946 to South Africa, when he played to black audiences, despite angry complaints from Daniël François Malan, head of the National Party and the future prime minister who was one of the chief architects of apartheid two years later. When Beryl kissed a young black girl who presented Formby with a box of chocolates, Malan sought the couple out to shout at them. “Why don’t you piss off, you horrible little man?” replied Beryl. They were ordered out of the country, never to return. By the late 1950s, life was becoming more difficult for the couple, despite the opulence of their home in Fairhaven, Lytham, which was originally called Cintra, but which Formby’s wife immediately renamed as ‘Beryldene’. Formby was closer to his dog Willie Waterbucket than he was to wife. Although Formby had been warned to take it easy after his heart attack in 1949, he was still smoking 40 Capstan Full Strength and Woodbine cigarettes a day – cheerfully calling them his “coffin nails” – and eating lots of beef-dripping toast. As Beryl’s cancer worsened she sought solace in drinking, sometimes consuming a bottle of whisky a day. She was 59 when she died on Christmas Day 1960. Beryl’s illness had allowed him free access to conduct the affair with Yana, but when that ended – and with work now intermittent – Formby turned his attention to a local woman called Pat Howson. Formby was a friend of her father Fred (who as general manager of Loxhams Car Showroom in Preston had sold him cars) and Formby sometimes took the Howson family on holiday on his boat on the Norfolk broads. Pat Howson, then 35, taught religious education and was sympathetic when Formby told her that Beryl, an atheist, “tried to turn me away from my Catholic religion”. In February 1961, they announced their engagement. “I first met her when she was nine, just a pretty little schoolgirl in ringlets,” 56-year-old Formby told The Daily Mirror. He said they reunited after his wife’s death and after a fortnight of courting he “popped the question”. Just two days before the wedding, on March 6 1961, Formby died of heart failure. The aftermath of his death was engulfed in rancour. Formby’s mother Eliza vetoed Howson’s funeral arrangements and had her son buried in Warrington instead of Preston. Although Formby left almost all his £2.2 million estate to Howson, his 82-year-old mother took the matter to court, reportedly saying her family would “fight that little floozy schoolma’am with their last breath”. The legal battle lasted nearly a decade before a compromise was reached. The money seemed cursed, however. Howson died of ovarian cancer in 1971, aged just 46. Eliza lived on until 1981, when she died at 102. The 150,000 fans who lined the 20-mile route of Formby’s funeral procession knew little of the truth about Formby’s life. They simply loved one of their own, a man who admitted that, “I’m just a clown without the make-up, the circus clown who magnifies the reactions of ordinary people to the things that happen around them.”"

The tragic life of Randolph Churchill, trapped in his father’s shadow
","
The Royal Family could learn a thing or two from Josh Ireland's new book, Churchill & Son, about surviving fiery family rows
",David Lough,"
28 March 2021 • 10:00am
","In April 1929, Randolph Churchill warmed up a crowd of 2,000 at one of his father Winston’s election rallies. Although only 17, he spoke for 20 minutes without notes. His father proudly forecast that Randolph would prove the third Churchill in a row to scale the high reaches of British politics, eclipsing the two William Pitts. Randolph’s performance was no flash in the pan. He had, in his own words, “imbibed politics in his mother’s milk” and sat in from an early age on much of his father’s political life. Winston aimed to treat his son generously in contrast to the disdain he felt had suffered from his father. There were already those who felt that Winston had overcompensated; among them was Randolph’s mother, Clementine, who had to compete with her son for her husband’s attention. Randolph was 19 when Winston put an arm around him before confiding that he probably owed his success to his father’s early death. “It left the political arena clear for me. I do not know how I should have fared in politics had he lived on.” Randolph’s own political ambitions died by inches over the next quarter of a century, while his father continued to inhabit the political top table. Josh Ireland’s Churchill & Son turns the volatile relationship between Winston and Randolph into a compelling tragedy, but one which casts valuable new light on the outsized human dimensions of both men. Do not be discouraged by the first two chapters concerning Winston’s relationship with his own father, where the ground is already well-trodden and Ireland’s narrative somewhat breathless. Once Randolph arrives on the scene the book takes flight and stays aloft. Ireland’s research is far-reaching, his writing wonderfully light and the story excellently told. Randolph has traditionally attracted unforgiving coverage of his bad behaviour. Ireland does not shirk the evidence of parties ruined, dinners gatecrashed, friendships destroyed, ruinous episodes of gambling and drinking. Winston often had to pick up the pieces – all the more galling as Randolph was being chauffeured around in a Bentley, while Winston made do with a Wolseley. Some of the rows between father and son turn so fiery that we wonder whether we have any right to eavesdrop. The Windsors have proved more adept than the Churchills at keeping their family rows private (until recently), as a result of burning letters and buttoning up their archive. The Churchills have burned almost nothing, handed their private papers to open archives and written about each other constantly. So historians can hardly be blamed for moving in. The Windsors, by contrast, could learn a thing or two from the Churchills about making up. Each time Winston and Randolph finish an argument by vowing never to speak to the other again, they reconcile (often with tears, seldom with delay). On one such occasion late in his father’s life, Randolph insulted one guest too many at a Chartwell dinner and stormed upstairs to tell his sleeping wife to pack her bags immediately because they were leaving, never to return. Winston, in his dressing gown, was soon at their door. “I am going to die soon. I cannot go to bed without composing a quarrel,” he announced before kissing them both. They stayed. Throughout, Ireland retains an underlying sympathy for Randolph, paying tribute to his generosity and courage. He was “entirely his father’s creation”, yet was denied the opportunity to carve out his own political identity. The closest he ever came was the five years in wartime he spent as MP for Preston, a seat he acquired unopposed, thanks to a pact between the coalition parties. When the time came for a real election in 1945, Randolph wished to hire an elephant from the local zoo in order to address the voters from its lofty howdah. The zoo was willing; his party officials not so. He lost the seat comfortably. Randolph may never have emerged from his father’s shadow, but Ireland reveals how often in the 1930s Winston benefited from Randolph’s introductions or used him to undertake sensitive political missions. In wartime, Winston would command Randolph’s presence by his side at allied conferences; General Alexander witnessed them embrace on arrival, “in a moment of deep tenderness”. In this agonising but excellent book, father and son manage to illuminate each other. As Ireland explains: “They had spent so many hours together, locked in conversation, that they had come to inhabit the same mental space.” Randolph, the author concludes, spent most of his life “trapped in a cage built by his father”. Now, where else have we recently heard that?"

The handshake is deeply biological – we can't let Covid kill it off
","
Ella Al-Shamahi's The Handshake charts the history of the gesture, from Perseus to Prince Philip – and rails against the limp alternatives
",Jake Kerridge,"
28 March 2021 • 5:00am
","I have had an awkward relationship with the handshake over the years. As a boy scout, much of my early handshaking was done with the left hand (as is scout tradition), leading to derision when I unthinkingly proffered my left hand outside scouting circles. Then there is the terror of having your hand crushed by overzealous shakers, or, even worse, receiving one of those limp handshakes that feel like you’ve got your hand round an expiring fish in its final pathetic throes; or the fear of falling short as a shaker oneself. I am not alone – apparently 70% of people in the UK are not confident about their hand-shaking technique – but Ella Al-Shamahi insists that we’re overthinking it. “The handshake is not the end game. Human connection is.” Al-Shamahi – a palaeoanthropologist by day and a stand-up comedian by night – is a handshake proselytiser. This book is an act of defiance against those, such as the US Chief Medical Advisor Anthony Fauci, who have called for it to be consigned to the dustbin of history as unhygienic. She emphasises the symbolic importance of such moments as Princess Diana shaking hands with AIDS patients, and scorns the WHO’s favoured alternative, the elbow bump. Although she has a soft spot for the penis handshake of the Australian Walbiri tribe, she concludes that nothing beats the traditional handshake as a mark of belief in equality (remember the Peasants’ Revolt leader Wat Tyler insisting on shaking hands with Richard II?) and mutual respect. Nobody is more zealous than a convert, and Al-Shamahi’s passion stems from her having been forbidden to shake hands for much of her life. In accordance with strict Muslim law, she avoided physical contact with men for many years – during “what I affectionately call my fundamentalist period” – but found that alternatives such as saluting didn’t cut the mustard. Having become more secular in her thinking in recent years, she has been able to discover the handshake’s merits. “I cherish that easy bond between all humans,” she writes. “To be tactile, I would argue, is the best way to build a connection. Touch unites us in a way that keeping our distance can’t bridge.” Her book busts a few myths about the handshake – notably the prevalent idea that it began as a way of proving to a stranger that you had no weapon in your hand – and insists that it was not introduced to the world by Western missionaries or invented by the ancient Greeks: “starting at any of these points in time is akin to beginning a history of pop music at the Cheeky Girls; you missed a bit”. Instead, she argues, shaking hands is not “a learnt cultural tradition” but “something deeply biological in origin”; it is, after all, also practised by our near relative, the chimp. There’s a quick whiz through the science, with explanations of how shaking hands stimulates the nucleus accumbens and other reward-giving parts of the brain. The bulk of the book, however, deals with the symbolic and cultural functions of the handshake. Early recorded examples include paintings showing Cepheus shaking hands with Perseus after he rescued his daughter Andromeda from the sea monster Cetus: “This is the handshake as a gesture of approval, endorsement, a cousin not far removed of Paul Hollywood’s prized ‘Hollywood handshake’, used by the Great British Bake Off star to commend an especially delectable bake”. (Incidentally, I note from this week’s episode that Hollywood still doles out his handshake in defiance of social distancing guidelines; is it deemed so important to the nation’s spirits that he’s been given an official exemption?) Al-Shamahi does admit, though, that handshakes can go awry, and duly provides an amusing anthology of their doing so, from the poor old Taoiseach Enda Kenny humiliatingly flapping his hand at an oblivious Barack Obama to the assassination of the US President William McKinley, whose insistence on meeting and greeting the public made him an easy target. Oddly enough she doesn’t mention Robert Mugabe, who was always gleefully hustling people – Prince Charles and Jack Straw among them – into shaking hands with him at busy gatherings before they had a chance to realise who he was; the fuss this caused attests to the symbolic power attached to the handshake. Will it return? Hand shaking often disappears during epidemics – “the old custom of shaking hands fell in such general disuse, that many shrank back with affright at even the offer of a hand,” William Carey observed during the US yellow fever outbreak of 1793, and you can have a lot of fun trying the same thing on passers-by today – but it has always bounced back. Having not particularly missed shaking hands over the past year, I ended this very engaging little book so desperate to get started again that I’m in danger of becoming a super-spreader. When I start meeting people again I’m going to be constantly batting my right arm down with my left, Strangelove style. Al-Shamahi might have spared a thought, however, for the malign consequences on those who are condemned to a lifetime of excessive shaking, such as the Royal Family; Prince Philip has blamed too much hand-shaking for exacerbating the arthritis in his wrists. Perhaps the respite from shaking hands means that the Royals will have at least one reason to look back over this past year with some nostalgia."

Black Crowes interview: ‘We're the last of the trouble-makers’

OCD, money feuds, and a $100,00-a-year cannabis habit: the now reunited Robinson brothers reveal why they didn't speak for six years
",Ian Winwood,"
8 March 2021 • 5:00am
","Following the breakup of the Black Crowes, on the penultimate day of 2014 the group’s front man, Chris Robinson, played a concert for a thousand people at the Cervantes Masterpiece Ballroom, in Denver. Trading under the name the Chris Robinson Brotherhood, the band were on the road in a van; not just this, they were setting up their own equipment, too. They had to – the singer needed the money.  Interested parties looked on askance. In his deliciously vengeful memoir Hard To Handle: The Life and Death of the Black Crowes, the group’s erstwhile drummer Steve Gorman writes that, “Chris seems to think that singing Black Crowes songs on occasion with a pickup band is in some way meaningful, but it’s dubious to suggest those shows are about anything beyond financial desperation.” Remarkable, really. In the final 10 years of the 21st Century, the Black Crowes sold somewhere in the region of 15-million albums. Re-issued last week in expanded form, the Atlanta quintet’s debut LP, Shake Your Money Maker, from 1990, found an audience of five million people in the United States alone. A year before Nirvana gatecrashed the mainstream, the “Crowes” were the first wholly credible international rock success story of the decade.  “All that record sales money, that’s long gone,” Chris Robinson tells me. On the line from his home in Colorado, about this the 54 year old sounds not all bothered. “We weren’t taken care of in that way at all. I’m not a person who’s very savvy with his finances. My wife knows that, my kids know that, we’re all good. Sometimes just doing things for money is like the most boring and worst thing. You can just see it in a band you love sometimes. No matter where they are in their career, when they just dial it in for the money there’s a light that goes out.” The quote is instructive. Wedded to honourable notions of artistic purity – as far back as 1992, the singer was bemoaning record executives “who call music ‘product’” – with tracks such Remedy, Sometimes Salvation and My Morning Song the Georgians were once giants. With better lines of communication, and with better advice, as with Pearl Jam they might have become an enduring stadium-sized worldwide institution. Instead, dependably fractious they proved capable of cocking up  .   On rhythm guitar the group’s line-up featured Rich Robinson, the singer’s younger brother. Today reunited as a two-man band, following the second of the Black Crowes’ two breakups, in 2014, the siblings didn’t speak for six years. The fracture occurred after Chris Robinson demanded a larger share of the money. “There will be no negotiation or wriggle-room when it comes to the percentages below,” the band were told, via email. Asked about this today, in mitigation the front man says that “I felt that the only way to make [the band] stop would be to ask for the one thing that I knew no one would go for”.  “As a family, the Robinsons aren’t good communicators anyway,” Rich Robinson tells me. “No one ever wanted to address [something that] had just happened. So it was easier for us to pretend that it didn’t happen and just keeping moving on. But ultimately it comes down to communication and transparency… [otherwise] you don’t talk for months and you’re onstage resenting the sh*t out of someone who’s your partner. How can you be in a band like that? How does that even work? The answer is you can’t, and it doesn’t, ultimately.” The Robinsons were merely the latest in a long-line of quarrelsome rock siblings. On the road with  , in 1996, the two groups titled their co-headline campaign The Tour Of Brotherly Love. Mark Lanegan, the singer with opening band Screaming Trees, arranged to have a fistfight with Liam Gallagher after the final date, in Miami (the concert was cancelled). Asked today, Rich Robinson recalls the rambunctious caravan as being “one of the most fun tours that I can remember”. “The two groups had a kinship because we’re two stubborn-ass brothers from Atlanta who would tell people to f*** off, and they were two stubborn-ass brothers from Manchester who would also tell people to f*** off,” he says. “So there was a mutual respect there.” As different as chalk and spaceships, in the days when he was spending $100,000 per annum on cannabis Chris Robinson married movie star Kate Hudson. Cocaine and (on occasion) heroin was also stirred into the mix. Three years his junior, crippled by anxiety and Obsessive Compulsive Disorder, Rich Robinson remained abstinent. “Drugs tapped into every fear and anxiety that I ever had, so I stayed away from them,” he says.  “I had some moments with drugs, but I knew where I was,” Chris Robinson says. “I knew what I was doing. There were a few times in the late Nineties, or a certain period in the Nineties, where depression just got a hold of me, but… for the most part I had an amazing time. It is what it is, I’m not ashamed. Back then I didn’t have children; I didn’t have responsibilities to anyone else. It’s as if I was a completely different being back then.” In 1990, the Black Crowes came out of nowhere. Signed by producer George Drakoulias to Rick Rubin’s Def American label (now American Recordings), in Atlanta the group’s name would draw crowds of fewer than a hundred people. In lieu of a local following, or anything like a buzz, instead they had a berth on a fast-emerging maverick imprint that would soon be recognised as one of the most fearless in North America. Green they may have been, but suddenly the Crowes shared a roster with Slayer, the Geto Boys, Danzig and the Jesus and Mary Chain.  Released on February 13 1990, to the casual ear Shake Your Money Maker was simply a persuasive mélange of classic Seventies American rock and The Faces without the boorishness. But within the grooves there was something deeper, and more sinuous. Forget Rod the Mod, the Black Crowes learned their most important lessons at the feet of punk bands such as The Replacements and X. Seeing REM play Aerosmith’s Toys In The Attic at the Fox Theater, in Atlanta, Rich Robinson thought, “I want .”  It was more than lip service, too. After Chris Robinson (not for the first time) criticised ZZ Top’s decision to allow the Miller Brewing Company to sponsor their live campaign, following a hometown show at the Omni the Georgians were bounced from the opening slot on tour. Speaking to MTV, Robinson explained that “I can see them being defensive about corporate sponsorship. But we’re not sponsored by anyone. We’re the Black Crowes.” There was plenty more where that came from. Spoiling for a scrap, when Tower Records offered to hoist a Black Crowes promotional flag on the roof of their iconic store, on Sunset Boulevard, the band insisted it fly at half mast. “It’s a symbolic gesture that says to all the people in the capital of the music industry that we’re in mourning for the death of rock’n’roll,” Chris Robinson told the writer Max Bell, in 1991. “Think about that instead of what’s in the charts and all the demographic bullsh*t.” Unencumbered by anhedonia, other members of the band were not quite so enamored of their singer’s tireless crusade to start a fight in every empty room in the world. With a clearly delineated hierarchy – the Robinsons wrote all the songs – Gorman, bassist Johnny Colt and lead guitarist Marc Ford, who joined in 1991, tended to regard their singer’s expectorations with a mixture of weariness and irritation. Gaining a taste for the trappings of fame, some people just wanted to rock.  “The second we got some success there were certain people who wanted to play it safe,” says Chris Robinson, unrepentant to the last. “They’d say, ‘Oh we’ve got a big tour, man, and we’ve got mortgages to pay’. Well I’m not here to pay your f****** mortgage, man. I’m here to sop up all these experiences like a big piece of French bread with some nice gravy. Those guys knew that when they met me. Especially back then, when the world was wild and rock’n’roll was a thing, you know.” If the Black Crowes appeared temperamentally unsuited to fame, who wouldn’t be? In the year before alternative music turned the mainstream upside down, Chris Robinson’s barbed mouth was seen by many as evidence of chippiness, or ingratitude. In 2021 the singer still says things like “you don’t want to get a whiff of the corporate f****** assholes of the music industry”; 30 years earlier, quintuple platinum he was simply another newbie millionaire left alone to deal with the consequences of life-changing success.  “It was a shock,” is how Rich Robinson describes the music industry’s most glaring deficiency. “None of us were ever taught how to handle success. There was no manual. We were just left on our own to deal with things. And that comes into play when we’re talking about drama and how we handled ourselves. We did the best we could, but it was definitely shocking. This thing fell in our laps.” On record, the Black Crowes were a world-class group for barely two years. Released in 1992, then and now the band’s second album, The Southern Harmony And Musical Companion, is rightly regarded as a capstone of American rock music. Recorded in only nine days, the organic masterpiece found its authors in altitudinous form. As well as this, Def American’s rookie error in failing to exercise the option for a second record before the deadline for doing so elapsed meant that the group were able to renegotiate their royalty rate to a level befitting their superstar status. Long story short, it went to their heads. Costing $600,000, the band’s third album, Amorica, itself no dud – and it ought not to have been, it was recorded twice – tiptoed uneasily into a domestic scene dominated by Green Day and The Offspring. By now it was like Lynyrd Skynyrd trying to look hip at a party thrown by the Buzzcocks. Having survived the grunge revolution, by 1994 the Black Crowes were no longer hungry insurrectionists. Crabby as ever, instead they looked old before their time.    Inevitably, they toured themselves into the ground. Often obdurate, usually intense, occasionally boring, come the latter part of the Nineties the Crowes were as powerful and precise a musical unit as any on the circuit. But for all their nuance and finesse, Steve Gorman’s observation that “[Oasis] struck me as a ‘great songs, good band’ kind of a band, whereas I thought that [we] were often a ‘great band, good songs’ kind of a band” is piercingly true.  “The history of rock music shows quite clearly that the former succeeds far more than the latter,” he writes.   “I think our main mistakes were that we didn’t take some time to get off the treadmill,” says Chris Robinson. “But it’s kind of like being a fighter, they want you to fight as much as you can when you’re in your prime because you get the biggest purse. I felt at the time that I was somewhat savvy enough to realise the nuances of that. It doesn’t matter how good the music is, or how deep or soulful your expression is, they just want you to make them some money.”  By the 21st Century it was all a mess. Scrapping like tomcats, the Black Crowes fell out over royalties, over the cost of tour buses, and about how best to deal with members misusing hard drugs. A reliable theatre draw – even at their most popular, the group declined to move into arenas – by now the Georgians were playing corporate events for a hundred grand a pop. Nice work if you can get it, I suppose, but a distant cry from the days of railing against a beer company sponsoring a tour on which they were merely special guests.   For his part Steve Gorman recalls that “there were fistfights on the [tour] bus. There were insults lobbed at wives. There were threats given and received with staggering regularity. It never ended, so it never began anew. It was constant. And every night, through all of that [there] were [other] things that happened that Chris and Rich couldn’t be bothered to notice.” To no one’s surprise, neither Robinson brother will admit to having read their drummer’s 346-page letter of revenge. “I get that the last bit of money he can get is to make me and Rich look bad,” says the singer, adding “I’m just not interested in his point of view.” On the line from Tennessee, the younger sibling says something that to me sounds valid. “Steve Gorman told me one time that the thing that scared everyone the most was when me and Chris got along,” he says. “And I thought, ‘What a really f***** up way to look at things. All of our greatest records and successes with the band happened when Chris and I were on the same page. And when that’s the case, whether or not that’s counter to people’s little power grabs, a rising tide floats all boats.” Which is why, even now, it is surely unwise to write off the Black Crowes. In recent publicity photographs, the Robinson brothers look like the kind of bearded and suited Southern gentlemen who have never once raised their voices in anger. The fact that their group has burned through fifteen members suggests otherwise. But with an American tour having fallen prey to the virus, instead the pair have written a batch of songs that Rich Robinson describes as “our best in decades”. If this is true, and should their authors be able to cleave together, for the first time in an age the results might just be remarkable.  “There’s nothing wrong with success and there’s nothing wrong with ambition,” Chris Robinson tells me. “I’m lucky to be in one of the last generations of people who caused trouble. It might look destructive in my career, but I didn’t care what the record company had to say. I still don’t care. Those guys don’t live like me, they don’t look like me, and they don’t smell like me. It’s part of that idea of the artist as the outsider. It’s about being able to find beauty and art in madness.  "

Meet Lady Mary Wortley Montagu, Britain's first vaccinator
","
Jo Willett's biography tells how the aristocratic female adventurer brought smallpox inoculation to this country from Turkey in 1721
",Lucasta Miller,"
28 March 2021 • 5:00pm
","In April 1721, at a villa in Twickenham, a Scottish doctor called Charles Maitland deliberately made scratches in the wrists and ankles of a three-year-old girl and introduced into the wounds some pus he had taken from the sores of a smallpox victim. This was first time anyone in England had ever been inoculated. The person responsible for making it happen was the child’s mother, Lady Mary Wortley Montagu, one of the most talented and unconventional women of the 18th century. Today, the millions of us who have already received our   have Lady Mary to thank for pioneering in the West what was then called “engraftment”. She had first come across it in Constantinople, where she had spent two years with her husband when he was posted as ambassador to the , Dr Maitland accompanying them as their household physician. In Turkish families it had long since been the custom to employ an old woman to collect the smallpox pus in a glass vessel, keeping it warm by placing it under her armpit on her way back, and then transferring it into walnut shells, which were later strapped onto the small cuts on the arms and legs into which the infected matter was smeared. After around eight days, the subjects would develop a mild fever and a few spots, from which they would soon recover, leaving them with lifelong immunity to full-blown smallpox. Lady Mary knew the  . Smallpox had left her with a pock-marked face and no eyelashes, and it had killed her brother. She was not, as the subtitle of this book suggests, a laboratory “scientist”, but her biographer Jo Willett is right to stress the crucial role she played in promoting “engraftment”. Despite bitter opposition from the anti-vaxxers of her day, she persuaded the Royal family to inoculate their children and personally performed the operation on her aristocratic contacts. In 1755, the Royal College of Physicians finally endorsed the practice. Lady Mary’s independent spirit had been apparent from childhood. She taught herself Latin in her father’s library and then went on to defy him by marrying without his consent. Her role in medical history should not be allowed to overshadow her literary career. A writer of both verse and prose, she became the confidante and sparring partner of the poet Alexander Pope, though they later fell out. Probably, Pope – who was well under five foot tall owing to a disabling childhood illness – fell in love and was rejected. His subsequent bile prompted her, in later life, to decorate her commode with a design of book backs with his name on the spines. Lady Mary’s vivid Turkish letters have become a travel-writing classic, their prose still fresh, though written 300 years ago. She was an early feminist, angry at the way women were disadvantaged in her society. Yet her gender was a boon when it came to her study of Turkish customs, as she had privileged access to enclosed female spaces. When she visited a crowded women’s hammam, she was the only lady there with a stitch on. The others encouraged her to undress too. When she opened her outer garments to display her stiff stays, the local women surmised in horror that her husband must have locked her up in such a “machine”. Whether Western or Eastern women were freer seemed a moot point to Lady Mary as she compared their daily lives and legal positions. Willett is keen to champion her subject as a public health campaigner. However, the woman who emerges from this book is a more complicated, and interesting, individual than that image suggests. At times, Lady Mary seems startlingly close; elsewhere, she embodies the strangeness of the past as another country. In her, all the mind-bogglingly incestuous conflicts of her day – Whigs, Tories, Jacobites, European wars, you name it – intersected in some way. Her contemporaries found her uncategorisable and contradictory. She was acknowledged as the most intelligent woman of her generation, yet ended up the dupe of a conman. She eloped with a man she didn’t really love, yet wrote him touching letters during their subsequent long separation. In middle age she fell for a handsome young Italian, unaware all the while that he was bisexual and sleeping with her friend, Lord Hervey. This book tells a rich and fascinating story. I kept hankering after a bit more sustained quotation from Lady Mary’s own writings, and I wasn’t convinced by the invented dialogue in the opening chapter. But I was won over by Willett’s passionate commitment to her subject – that blazing “comet” of a woman, as one of her contemporaries put it."

The tumultuous final years of Janis Joplin – by her brother and sister

Drugs and excess took over the late singer’s image. But now, as they release a deeply personal book, her siblings tell us of the good times

","On August 14 1970,   went home. Thomas Jefferson High School in Port Arthur, Texas, was holding a 10-year reunion. Joplin rocked up in hippie flares, a scoop-necked T-shirt, a feather boa that she wore as a hat, and her trademark round, colour-tinted sunglasses. At the time, the 27-year-old singer and songwriter was one of the biggest counter-cultural forces in America. An incendiary performer on- and off-stage, she was a hippie style icon and feminist trailblazer who’d made her name on the San Francisco scene as frontwoman with Big Brother and the Holding Company. Her incredible blues range saw her credited as having “The Voice of a Lady Leadbelly”, as the New York Free Press headlined a February 1968 profile. The previous summer Joplin had been one of the star performers at Woodstock, managing to cut through the stoned fug and 2am start time with an earth-shaking performance. As The Who’s Pete Townsend wrote in his memoir, Who I Am: “She had been amazing at Monterey, but tonight she wasn t at her best, due, probably, to the long delay, and probably, too, to the amount of booze and heroin she d consumed while she waited. But even Janis on an off-night was incredible.” Indeed. As The Washington Post wrote in April 1968 of her stage persona: “She screams, she stomps, she jumps, she quivers, she flails her arms, she flings her great wild mane like an unbroken pony.” Later that summer of 1970, Joplin would begin work on her second solo album, Pearl, which would feature some of her best-known songs, including her cover of 1963 R&B track Cry Baby and her own (co-written) Mercedes Benz. But before that, there was that detour back to Port Arthur, the small, conservative Texan community in which, as a beatnik-channelling teen rebel, she’d never felt at home. “It was a formal event and it was an awkward fit!” recalls her 72-year-old sister, Laura, laughing. She accompanied Janis, six years her elder, to the reunion, and wore a dialled-back version of her sister’s fabulous freak-out garb. “Everyone else was in straight, middle-class clothing and teased hair. There was a sense they didn’t quite know what to do about her. But in my mind, and in Janis’s, they should have made her attendance and her success one of the central points to celebrate – ‘Look what someone from our high school has achieved!’ “However, the guy running things thought in terms of how many people had law degrees. It was only when the president of the class said, ‘What about Janis Joplin?’ that everyone stood up and applauded. “I think that hurt her feelings. No matter what she did, she could not get applause from her classmates.” Even then, the recognition was miserly. At the reunion, Janis was symbolically gifted a tyre, to represent “that she’d come the farthest”. And that was meant literally. “That’s what I find most insulting,” says Laura, audibly pained 51 years later. “Instead of being the person who had reached the greatest visible recognition in the country, Janis got a tyre for having travelled the longest distance.” Later that same night, the Joplin girls went to see Jerry Lee Lewis play in Port Arthur. Janis was proud to be able to take her little sister backstage to meet the man, part of “a desire to show she had connections with powerful people.” Nonetheless, it was an “unfortunate experience. He couldn’t have been more rude. He looked at me and looked at her and said: ‘You wouldn’t be bad-looking if you weren’t trying to look like your sister.’ The jerk that he is,” Laura says, witheringly. “That really hurt Janis. So she punched him.” Less than three months later, Janis Joplin was dead. Half a century on from her heroin overdose in Hollywood – midway through the Pearl recording sessions – her visceral, moon-shooting, too-close-to-the-sun artistry and personality are opened up in a lavish new book. Janis Joplin: Days & Summers: Scrapbook 1966–68 is centred on exactly that: Janis’s own scrapbook from those tumultuous two years, the period in which she broke into the international consciousness at 1967’s Monterey Pop Festival and then, the following year, had career-launching US hits with covers of the soul standard Piece of my Heart and George Gershwin’s Summertime. It features newspaper clippings, press photographs, far-out Sixties concert poster art, letters and postcards home, doodles and, in her own handwriting, Janis’s diary entries. “Speaking of England,” begins one 1967 note, “guess who was in town last week – Paul McCartney! (He’s a Beatle.) And he came to see us!!! SIGH.” This ambitious – not to mention pricey – limited-edition book, in part curated by Laura Joplin and her brother Michael, 67, also features pages from an earlier scrapbook, dated 1956 to 1959 and kept by Janis while she was at high school. Alongside those DIY pages are revealing interviews with myriad friends, collaborators, peers and admirers, including Fleetwood Mac, Grace Slick of Jefferson Airplane, friend Kris Kristofferson (with whose song, Me and Bobby McGee, Janis had a posthumous US number one in 1971), and fans Michelle Phillips, Jimmy Page and Chrissie Hynde. To quote the last of these, who saw Janis perform in in Richfield, Ohio, “there was just no one else like her – total rebelliousness, abandon, musical excellence and total connection with everyone in the audience. Pure magic. Everybody loved her. She gave us a voice that was anti-establishment, and I’ve lived by it ever since.” This is a deeply personal, kaleidoscopic, hippie-vivid portrait of a woman finding her way in the world, and a window into the dizzying contours of America in the mid- to late-Sixties. Harder to divine is the darkness inside that compelled Janis to overindulge to the extent that it killed her. As Kristofferson describes her in his afterword, which comes in the form of poem titled Epitaph, this was a woman “born so black and blue”. “Janis’s scrapbook has been a personal family thing for such a long time,” begins her brother Michael, down the line from Arizona, “and we’d all looked at it, and laughed and pointed and wondered and cried. And we never felt like sharing that personal, gut-wrenching family thing. But after a while it became obvious that it was something of not just interest but importance. After keeping it that way for decades, it just seemed the right time to do something with it.” As Laura writes in the introduction, from childhood her big sister was always keen on “logging” her life. “It certainly was a steady part of who she was from early on,” she tells me, speaking on the phone from California. “That may have been a reflection of our mother – she chronicled our lives on photo scrapbooks. Janis’s scrapbook told you a lot about what she valued, what was important to her, what gave her joy. I remember her working on that scrapbook in her bedroom, cutting things out and doodling. So there’s a sense of her vitality whenever I look at it. It feels more alive.” Janis stayed in touch with her family after she moved to the West Coast in pursuit of her musical dreams. Michael remembers that move as “the logical progression. There wasn’t much in our town. If you wanted to work at the oil refinery, that was fine. But our parents supported us – if you wanted make music or art, go for it.” In the talismanic summer of 1967, the family made the long car journey to visit San Francisco and see Janis at home and, as it were, in action. For Laura, who had just graduated from school, and Michael, then 14, it was “mindblowing” to tour Haight-Ashbury with their big sister and see her perform with Big Brother at the Avalon Ballroom. Michael even had a go at manning the concert lighting rig. “I’m a wannabe hippie in every aspect,” says Michael, who now makes a living as a glassblower. “And I was so proud of Janis. Everybody in there treated with us absolute respect. There were all in awe of her, and [to us] they were helpful, respectful and kind: ‘Yeah, come on and do the light show! Watch the dancing! Listen to all this!’ Big Brother showed up, and they and the dancers and the hippie freaks were proud that we were there. They were protective, too. They weren’t just Big Brother – they were big brothers.” For Mr and Mrs Joplin, it was a different experience. “They were totally out of their realm,” remembers Michael, “so they were really uncomfortable. But they could see that something was happening. They were small-town Texas people, so just the city itself was mind-blowing. And, of course, nobody knew at the time that the Avalon Ballroom in San Francisco, in that Summer of Love, was changing history. We just knew something was going on, but nobody knew what.” Alongside Janis’s mesmerising appeal as a blistering, unfiltered singer was her expression of raw sexuality. Even in the go-go late Sixties, that set her apart. “Part of [her] force is an open sensuality,” wrote The New York Times in April 1968, “with no tinge of coyness or come-on.” “The sex thing they keep trying to lay on me,” she told the newspaper, “is always in the receiver’s head, which is where it should be. If I turn anyone on that way – great! Because that’s what it’s all about.” But it wasn’t entirely accidental. Michael says his sister was a great “salesperson”, meaning: “She knew how to talk to the press, be available to the press… She was trying to sell the music and herself.” Equally, Laura points out, “There wasn’t a cerebral Janis and a [separate] sexual Janis. Her entirety was an expression of her art, and sexuality was part of that.” Likewise, she adds, her sister’s fashion sense. “Our mother raised us to be creative about we wore. Mother sewed, and she always got us involved with designing the clothes we were wearing. So we were using fashion magazines, going to the store and picking fabric. Both Janis and I sewed and made some of our clothes. Mother thought that was a basic skill that women needed to know. “And Janis just took it farther. She combined that knowledge of fabric and shaping it for your body along with her artistic flair. So it really grew.” The bangles up her forearms, the feathers, beads, headgear and layers “all became a real sense of her – decorating your body as an expression of who you are”. But even from early on, there had been a sense that Janis was overdoing everything. Michael remembers an early visit home when his sister was clearly “strung out”, as he writes in the book. “She was obviously not well. I didn’t really understand what was going on, but she came contrite and wanting something different from what she had. And rightly so – she knew that [she had] some problems. Drugs and alcohol were not treated the same as they are now. People were like: ‘You just have to get your act together and everything’ll be OK.’ That’s what she came back to do, to get healthy and to figure out how to proceed in life in a more rational way. But she didn’t know what that was.” Does he mean strung out on heroin? “Ah, well, I mean… I’m still protective of my sister, so I don’t like saying a lot of that. But she was strung out on drugs, and drinking, and being poor as bejesus, and not eating. She was trying to stay afloat, and not able to.” Nonetheless, her good friend and Big Brother bandmate Dave Getz is quoted in the scrapbook thus: “You can’t talk about Janis without talking about heroin.” “There’s probably some truth in that,” allows Michael. “People have accused me of trying to protect her, and of course I do. But she did heroin. She did massive amounts of drugs and alcohol, and she slept around. What am I going to protect her from? So yeah, heroin was definitely involved in her life. She liked to do drugs and alcohol and get laid. What can I say? Everybody did.” In January I interviewed  – who, like Janis, was managed by the fearsome Albert Grossman – and the producer recalled his ultimately ill-fated attempts in early summer 1970 to prepare the groundwork for the recording of Pearl. “I hadn’t worked with an artist like her before,” he told me. “I was very much about the musical aspect, getting everyone together to do a performance in the studio somehow, and not mess around too much with the psychology or play head games. “And Janis, I think, hated making records. She loved playing live. That was her life – to get up in front of an audience, freak out and do her thing. But she was just never comfortable in the studio because there was no audience.” Equally, he added, “she in some ways was like a crazy teenager. She’d suddenly go off on a whim of some kind. I recall being in her house in Mill Valley [near San Francisco], and a bunch of people are coming in with songs for her, and then I get a call in from Janis: ‘I’m gonna be late, I’m at the police station!’ “Five minutes later, I walk past her bedroom, and the door’s open and she’s in there with some guy! She’s calling from her own bedroom, making excuses for not showing up because she doesn’t want to get out of bed with some guy she’s picked up the night before!” Rundgren eventually left the project after recording moved to Los Angeles. As he admits, “it became apparent that I didn’t have the touch to get her to deliver in the studio. But after that they formed a band for her and that helped a lot – she finally had a musical unit she could interact with, and abandon herself to. And they found another producer, Paul Rothchild, whose style was completely different from mine. Mine was: ‘Let’s make some music in here.’ His was: ‘Let’s make everybody feel real good in here, and maybe the music will happen.’” The sessions, though, came to an abrupt halt on October 4 when Janis was found dead in her hotel room. For Mick Fleetwood, who knows of what he speaks, it was a sadly inevitable outcome of the hedonism of the scene. “Yes, she was a child in a toy shop,” he says in Days & Summers, “and it just became too much for her.” “None of us knew what we were doing with drugs – we were young and stupid,” admits Grace Slick. “We were either having a good time with them, or using them to calm down. When you felt bad, you’d go shoot some heroin or drink some alcohol or whatever. Everybody was doing it. Heroin is really tricky, because you only take a small dose and so then you think: ‘Oh, I’ll have a little bit more.’ But a little bit more will kill you.” Her death, terribly, was a sign of the times. “That whole rock star thing caught up with her, as it did with a lot of pop idols in the early Seventies,” says Rundgren of a singer who was an early member of what Kurt Cobain’s grief-stricken mother later called “that stupid club” – musicians who were dead at 27. Brian Jones, Jimi Hendrix and Jim Morrison were all that age when they died between 1969 and 1971. “There was this feeling of invincibility going around,” the producer continues. “Once you’d achieved that stardom, you got giddy. And it was proven several times over that these people weren’t invincible, with Morrison and Hendrix and Joplin all dropping like flies.” But it was, of course, also an awful family tragedy. When the news came, Laura was in Dallas, where she’d begun graduate school. She was at home alone in her shared apartment. “It was very difficult,” she says now, “to be surrounded by silence when internally I was very empty.” Michael was at home in Port Arthur. The call came in the middle of the night, and his father woke him in the morning. “He could barely get the words out. He said, ‘Your sister’s dead’, then he had to leave the room, because he was gonna lose it. “What was really weird was that I wanted to go tell somebody, and have that conversation with my best friend: ‘My sister passed away.’ But he already knew. ‘How did you know?’ ‘It was on the radio.’ That was my first taste that I didn’t have any [private] family thing about this. And my parents were not able to deal with that at all. It was so talked about – it was on the national freaking news!” In fact, so was Michael. When his parents travelled to California to make the arrangements, they left him at home. “They were afraid to have me part of that scene, which I understand. But they also didn’t realise that Dan Rather was going to call the house. And I’m there, waiting for them to call, so I answer the phone and I’m 17, talking to Dan Rather on the nightly news! We were just unaware of what was going to be transpiring. “That was a really hard time,” he continues. “My idol was dead. And it was tough. Mostly, if you ever lose a family member, they go away. And your memories are what keep them alive in you. But with this, I’m talking to you 50 years after – it’s crazy, a weird thing. You’ve got your perceptions of Janis, I have mine, and I can’t change everyone else’s.” Given the cultural lionisation – and the tearing down – of various Sixties and Seventies musical legends in the decades since, it’s remarkable that there’s been no film of the life of Janis Joplin. That’s not for the want of trying, notes Michael. Over the years, multiple actresses have been linked to the role, including Pink, Amy Adams, Michelle Williams and Courtney Love. “There’s been a lot of people in the talk, and until it happens, it’s only all talk. For a long time I was holding my breath, then I gave up because I started turning blue. Now I’m like, if you want to do it, you better come to me with something real. Until then, it’s just BS. It’s Hollywood, man. I have a drawer full of scripts!” But nothing that he and Laura thought was up to snuff? “We didn’t stop anything. We have never said no to anybody. I would love to have had Pink involved. But things just don’t happen – the funding fell through, or whatever. It’s just that kind of stuff. I’m not an a--hole or anything. If they can figure out how to make it happen, we’ll support them, if it’s good.” For Laura, looking after her sister’s memory – the family have been careful not to overexploit her legacy – “helped me heal a lot. Talking with people, feeling the incredible love they have for her, really helped me get more anchored. In that regard it’s a pleasure to listen and hear what she meant to people.” Also, she points out, for all the sense of a depressed and doom-laden mythos that’s attended her sister in subsequent years, “the thing that can sometimes be overlooked is: she was so much fun to be around. Janis was a high-energy girl who had an unending curiosity.” Or, as Janis said to Eye magazine in June 1968: “I have at least a thousand people inside of me and I don’t know which is the real me.” Those qualities are all over the deluxe, coffee-table pages of Janis Joplin: Days & Summers: Scrapbook 1966–68. Immerse yourself in the mind and soul and chaos of Joplin’s too-short life and career, and you understand why her siblings might still want their sister’s story told on screen, but told right. “There’s been a lot of powerful woman that wanted to portray her,” says Michael, “because Janis is a perfect story in every aspect. It’s like Shakespeare.”"

Kaleidoscope’s young blood is a little too cool, plus the best of March’s classical concerts
","
The chamber group’s all-French programme at Wigmore Hall was frequently beautiful and tender, but lacked a little trouble and turmoil
","Ivan Hewett, ","
30 March 2021 • 3:11pm
","While other venues sputter like damp fireworks, Wigmore Hall keeps going, bringing us top-level music-making day after day. Sometimes they even offer two concerts in a single day, which was normal back in “normal” times, but now seems like almost reckless profusion. Yesterday was one such cornucopia. In the evening, tenor Ian Bostridge and pianist Julius Drake performed Schubert, Debussy and Fauré; but first, at lunchtime, we heard four members of the recently formed chamber group Kaleidoscope, now an “associate ensemble” of the hall. They offered an all-French programme that reversed the normal order of a menu, going from feather-light trifle to meaty masterpiece. The trifle came from Melanie Bonis, one of those doughty 19th-century female composers who managed to make it in an almost exclusively male world. She’s now being rediscovered, but one has to hope there are stronger pieces among her 300 works than the two-movement Soir Matin (Evening Morning) we heard yesterday. In this performance the opening movement came across as gently beautiful – frankly, a bit too gentle. Perhaps if the playing had been more full-blooded, this collection of musical swags and furbelows might have been more engaging. The performers’ sweetly gentle approach was right for the more engaging Matin, which was interestingly troubled: more grey clouds than radiant new dawn. That slightly lop-sided emphasis on the intimate and gentle was evident in the performance of the Second Piano Quartet by Gabriel Fauré, which rounded off the concert. It’s true that much of the music inhabits a sweetly intimate world – the composer Aaron Copland described it admiringly as “a long sigh of infinite tenderness” – but that’s not the half of it. There’s real unruly passion under the soft outlines of the music, which didn’t always shine through in this performance. The second movement should burst with frustrated fury, but pianist Tom Poster softened the angry left-hand figure with a touch of pedal, and the plucked chords from the three string players were more polite than savage. Still, the tender moments were indeed tender, especially those in which violinist Elena Urioste’s drooping phrases were echoed by cellist Colin Carr, though the plaintive responses of violist Rosalind Ventris – the echoes finding their own echo, as it were – were actually the most affecting of all. In between the two billowing romantic effusions of Bonis and Fauré came the stark and stony D’un Soir Triste (A Sad Evening) by Lili Boulanger. Thanks to the recent revival of her music, it’s become clear that the early death at 24 of this slender, always-sickly woman was the most grievous loss in 20th-century music. This extraordinary piece, written in the shadow of the First World War, seems to come from some desolate, blasted region too dreadful even for sorrow – a quality the performers caught and held with just the right halting, stunned eloquence. You know you’re in for a good evening when the performers are visibly enjoying themselves. Pleasure in co-ordinated action always enlivens the sound as well as the look of a concert, and it gives an extra warmth to the music’s emotional qualities. That was certainly the case at this terrific Scottish Chamber Orchestra concert, which was curated and compèred by Louise Goodwin, one of the orchestra’s percussionists, filmed in Perth Concert Hall and now is streaming online. Goodwin came up with a short vivid programme that put Baroque and American minimalist composers together, so we could enjoy the shared obsession with repeating patterns and rhythmic energy. It’s a common enough conceit, but it worked especially well here, as the contrasts in emotional weight and sound were huge. Henry Purcell’s Chacony in G minor and D major Fantasia bookended the concert in a dancing mood, the intertwined lines in the two violins and viola nicely poised over the driving double-bass, cello and harpsichord. There was a different sort of poise in Steve Reich’s Nagoya Marimbas, more aloof and detached but with a suppressed joy, well caught in this performance from Goodwin and her fellow marimba player Rich Cartlidge. Then came the concert’s rapt still centre, in the shape of Fratres, the oft-played masterpiece by the Estonian so-called “holy minimalist” Arvo Pärt, played here in an arrangement for string quartet and two percussionists. Over a never-changing drone on viola, a patiently circling melody, intoned by the other three string players with exquisite softness, slowly gained weight as it descended. Between each descent, the two percussionists tapped out a rhythm in chipped wooden sounds and muffled bass drum that was tiny yet monumental. It was like some inscrutable ritual purged of human feeling, yet moving nevertheless. In this exalted company, the concert’s most recent piece, Dani Howard’s Shades, felt distinctly thin. The idea of a vibraphone solo in dialogue with its own “virtual” shadow – generated by a foot-pedal attached to a computer – produced some promising moments, and Goodwin relished the concert’s only opportunity for some tempo flexibility and expressive playing. But it felt like a sketch for something that needed to be bigger. This and everything else was blown away by Workers Union, a pungent piece of musical protest from the 1970s. Freedom through unity was a common slogan in those days, and the Dutch composer Louis Andriessen caught the idea brilliantly. It’s a piece for any number of players on loud instruments, all hammering away at driving syncopated rhythms in perfect co-ordination, but each left free to choose their own notes. It’s a piece I always imagined needed the brute physical impact of saxophones and brass played at ear-splitting volume, and the idea of transferring it to the polite Baroque-ish ensemble of strings and harpsichord seemed risky. In fact, it was wonderful. Andriessen once said Workers Union needed to sound aggressive, but he was wrong: it just needs to be joyous and superlatively well-drilled, and the music will seem triumphant – as it did here. Opera has not been an entirely closed book during lockdown, but sheer expense has proved a disincentive to the staging of full-dress filmed productions, of the kind recently mounted by some well-heeled European houses. Faced with this challenge, a few British counterparts have boldly repurposed themselves. English National Opera’s ENO Breathe workshops, for instance, put the expertise of its singers at the service of “long Covid” sufferers, helping them to harness the power of deep breathing and singing. For Opera North, instead of the audience going to the company, the company goes to the audience. Its ONe-to-ONe scheme offers short solo performances to patrons for free, given via Zoom by members of the orchestra and chorus. Unsurprisingly, it has caught on like wildfire. The first batch of 96 10-minute slots were snapped up within an hour. It’s a lucky dip: you might be offered a poetry reading, an instrumental recital or an aria. I logged on at the appointed time, and was faced with the cheerfully smiling face of Katie Walker, a mezzo-soprano in the chorus. There was a moment’s awkwardness on my part. How do you face a skilled performer who’s about to give a performance just for your benefit? I felt like some  king. But not for long, as Walker soon launched into one of my favourite arias, the impassioned Amour! viens aider ma faiblesse! (Love, come to the aid of my weakness!) from Camille Saint-Saëns’s Samson and Delilah. She performed with the aid of a pre-recorded orchestral background, and sang with such full-blooded passion that I felt I ought to stand to attention (or at least put down my coffee mug). Afterwards, I asked her how she finds these solo performances. “I love them,” she said simply. “It’s a way of actually meeting our audiences and finding out what they like.” My second slot, from orchestral leader David Creed, was just as enjoyable. He played a movement from Bach’s A minor Partita with engagingly forthright severity. And not all ONe-to-ONe performances are in fact one-to-one. I eavesdropped on a slightly longer performance for a Leeds care-home – given, again, by the indefatigable Walker. She sang Seguidilla from Carmen, a number from Kiss Me Kate and a tear-jerking Edwardian ballad, I’ll Walk Beside You. As far as I could judge, it went down a storm. Thus far there have been 162 performances, with more to come, and they’re sold out into April. In their modesty and intimacy, they’re as far from the grandeur of “normal” opera as you could imagine, and they must have carried the name of Opera North into places it has never reached before. That’s certainly a silver lining for the company, in these dark and difficult times. As this live-streamed concert reminded us, even the best-laid plans can be derailed by the pandemic. The LSO’s music director Sir Simon Rattle had invited star Canadian soprano Barbara Hannigan to sing two great 20th-century works with the orchestra, the rapturously nostalgic Knoxville: Summer of 1915 by Samuel Barber, and Edgard Varèse’s sultrily sinister Offrandes (Offerings). Both had to quarantine, as they were travelling from abroad – then, with rehearsals well under way, the test and trace system removed Rattle from the picture. It seemed as if a deputy conductor would have to be called in. Hannigan, however, had other ideas. She pursues a parallel career as a conductor, so why couldn’t she conduct Barber’s piece herself, as well as sing it? This wouldn’t be unprecedented for her, but to my knowledge she’s a unique case, for obvious reasons. The two roles of performing and conducting are often combined by concerto soloists; it was the norm in the 18th century. But there’s something about the physicality of singing that makes simultaneous conducting inconceivable – or so it seemed, until Hannigan came along. She had precisely 24 hours to prepare, and being a brilliant musician, pulled it off. To ask whether this also resulted in a moving performance might seem unfair. But, in truth, it didn’t quite come off. Hannigan was, as ever, elegantly unflappable and technically impeccable, soaring up to pianissimo top notes while cueing the clarinets with one hand and maintaining a pulse with the other. But expressively she seemed somewhat out-of-focus. Barber’s piece sets a rhapsodic prose poem by James Agee, in which the author looks back from regretful adulthood to his six-year-old self, who gazes up at the stars on a warm night while enjoying the cosy sound of adult voices murmuring in the dark. The piece emerges from deep peace and returns to it – yet Hannigan launched off in an anxiously tremulous manner. This meant that later, when the music became genuinely anguished, she had less room for manoeuvre. Rattle had in fact been released from quarantine in the nick of time, and he could have taken over, but he agreed to let Hannigan conduct anyway. This was gallant, but didn’t lead to the best musical result. Later in the evening, by contrast, for the performance of Varèse’s Offrandes, Hannigan was able to leave the orchestra in Rattle’s hands, and the results were superb. Varèse set two surrealist poems that evoke visions of ancient tropical deities, and Rattle and the LSO gave the opening just the right throaty primeval-swamp quality. Hannigan’s voice seemed to tip-toe amongst the fetid ticking and scraping of the percussion and the abrupt menace of the muted brass, and only at the end did the suppressed panic finally break out. We stayed with ancient pagan deities for The Song of Quetzalcoatl by Lou Harrison, that Californian devotee of all things far-away and ancient. Its austere rhythmic patterns, pattered out with unflappable control by four percussionists, were as aloof as Varèse’s piece was sinister. Finally, to banish these disquieting visions, came the rarely-performed complete ballet score of Ravel’s Ma mère l’Oye (Mother Goose). The sumptuous orchestral sound, garlanded with exquisite solo playing from oboist Juliana Koch, leader Roman Simović and others, wrapped us in nostalgia, and the closing tableau, Le jardin féerique (Fairy Garden), conducted by Rattle at a luxuriantly slow pace, glittered and shone like a vision of bliss. Mozart’s final opera, inspired by the jealousies and murderous intrigues around the nobly forgiving Roman emperor Titus Vespasian, can be a magnificent spectacle. All those processions of senators and noble ladies in their pomp, with the Forum in the background. At the climax of the first Act one of the conspirators actually burns down the Capitol, which is a chance for a properly picturesque apocalypse.   But not here. Spectacle and pyrotechnics are in distinctly short supply in Bergen National Opera’s new production. Originally due to be staged last March and then cancelled because of the pandemic, the production took place, as ever, at the Grieg Hall, where it was rethought from scratch to take account of social distancing rules on stage. When restrictions on travel became even more severe, a number of international singers had to be stood down and replaced with Norwegians, one or two of whom had to learn their parts in less than a fortnight. The London-based production team led by director Rodula Gaitanou had to work remotely, giving directions via computer screens. Frankly it’s a miracle the production took place at all, and certainly the difficult conditions have left their mark. In terms of mise-en-scène the black backdrop and black featureless stage seem at first just too austere to fire the imagination. The six characters in designer Cordelia Chisholm’s grey business suits are often seen at a row of desks at the back, suggesting that, when not maddened by jealous passion, they’re just a bunch of Imperial bureaucrats. When they are thus maddened, they dash forward and move in attitudes of fury or anguish between five well-spaced illuminated squares, as if to suggest the intrigues between them are like moves on a chess-board. This is a nice conceit, though why it had to be enacted quite so austerely is a mystery; surely a bit of colour would have helped. And giving Tito a chain of office like those worn by Lord Mayors wasn’t a good move. Combined with his perpetually worried look it made it seem as if he’d just been heckled at the opening of a new bus depot. Yet somehow the performance rose above the conceit and took wing. Things got off to the best possible start with the overture, performed by the Bergen Philharmonic Orchestra under their chief conductor Edward Gardner with startling energy. Then, before we had a chance to take a breath, on came soprano Beate Mordal in a sexy white trouser suit. She plays the nastiest of the conspirators Vitellia, spitting fury and impressive vocal pyrotechnics because Tito—whom she’d had her eye on—wants to marry a Jewish princess. She’s followed by her besotted admirer Sesto played by Adrian Angelico, who agrees reluctantly to be the assassin. And so the conspiracy takes shape.  Among the other roles, Ingeborg Gillebo as Sesto’s well-meaning friend Annio and Frøy Hovland Holtbakk as his sister Servilia are both equally vivid. Bror Magnus Tødenes seems under strain vocally as Tito, but he movingly conveys the anguish of the twice-betrayed Emperor.  But the real star of the show is the orchestra, above all the player on the basset horn whose sound rapturously entwines with the singers in the opera’s most beautiful arias. At the end, when all are forgiven and the terrific chorus and orchestra fling out the final chorus, the stage is flooded with light—suggesting that Tito is actually an Enlightenment monarch born ahead of time. Greyness gives way to radiance, a transformation we could all wish for at this moment. The vocal group Voces8 inspires awe. As well as singing like angels they run an educational foundation and their own venue, and throughout the lockdown they’ve offered filmed festivals of choral and other music which for production values and musical quality are second to none. Last night’s concert, the seventh in their Spring Festival, was conceived and led by none other than Dame Emma Kirkby. To call her the doyenne of British singers of the so-called “early” music would be no more than the simple truth. The pearly radiant tones of that voice, and Kirkby’s winning way with the words of old Italian and English texts made her for a while the best-selling British classical artist in Europe. But she’s so much more than that. She has an interest in song from every country and era, as this concert proved. And doyenne in any case seems the wrong word. It implies an aristocratic, haughty mastery, whereas Kirkby has the eagerness and vulnerable expressivity of a young singer, as she showed time and again. Some doyennes have capacious egos too, but at this concert from “Dame Emma Kirkby and Friends” the Dame refused to hog the show. The idea of a concert for Mothering Sunday devoted to songs about maternity from the 12th to the 21st century was entirely hers, but she ceded most of the limelight to her fine bunch of young singers and instrumentalists. Among them were lutenist Toby Carr and harpist Aileen Henry, agile and sensitive accompanists in Italian songs devoted to the Virgin. There was fine pianist Christopher Glynn, who accompanied Dame Emma in one of the more innocent songs from Paul Hindemith’s Das Marienleben (the Life of Mary). There was multi-instrumentalist Matt Redman, whose strumming guitar and banjo ushered us into the world of songs about motherhood from the Civil War and First World War, when anti-war protest was joined to a note of stoical grieving. Sharing the songs with Dame Emma were two mezzo-sopranos who were tellingly contrasted with her and each other. Patricia Hammond had the softer more cushioned voice of the two, and the combination of her caressing tone with soft-edged harmonium and piano in a movement from the Stabat Mater by Clémence de Granval—a little-known but clearly wonderful 19th-century Parisian composer—was the most deliciously tender moment of the evening. Helen Charleston had a darker sound, with a sharper expressive edge. She was spellbinding in Tarquinio Merula’s long lullaby sung by the Virgin to her child, rising to muted climaxes of sadness as she foresees the life that lies ahead of him. Dame Emma, not to be outdone, reminded us how well she communicates aspiration and fervour in Barbara Strozzi’s wonderful Hymn to the Virgin. The most radiantly beautiful moment of the evening actually came at the beginning, when all three singers joined in Hildegard of Bingen’s song in praise of the Virgin. The three voices rose and fell in waves of melody, so rhapsodic and free and weightless it felt as if it could continue for eternity. All praise to the Bournemouth Symphony Orchestra for continuing with their streamed concert series. We’ve missed the galvanising presence of their chief conductor, Kirill Karabits, but they’ve had a range of interesting guest conductors and soloists, including John Eliot Gardiner and Stephen Hough, who together gave a terrific performance of Brahms’s First Piano Concerto. Last night it was the turn of 32-year-old Polish conductor Marta Gardolińska, who led a programme of two crisp, classically-proportioned symphonies, separated by a delicious slice of Russian late-romanticism. Gardolińska was an athlete in a previous life, and she brought an invigorating light touch to Schubert’s symphony and an exact sense of tempo proportions, finding precisely the contrasting tempo for the swaying, bucolic middle section of the hearty third movement. Alas, the players were not as nimble as she. Every orchestra must be allowed the occasional off-night, and this was the clearly the BSO’s. The string ensemble was particularly patchy, especially in the finale – though here I sensed that Gardolińska was forcing the pace to a point where the music would have lost its smile anyway. The six minutes of rustling, undulating stillness that was Anatol Liadov’s The Enchanted Lake came as a welcome moment of summery charm. Liadov’s chief claim to fame was that he failed to deliver the music for Diaghilev’s ballet The Firebird, giving a break to a composer of whom no-one had heard – Igor Stravinsky. The Bournemouth SO’s playing here came into focus, and the music positively glowed. The interesting thing is that Liadov’s dreamy waterscape sounded very like some of the more enchanted moments in Stravinsky’s score. Sometimes the gap between talent and genius is not so great.   These two pieces were, in their different days, completely open and straightforward, with no dark corners or puzzling moments. By contrast, the final piece of the evening, Shostakovich’s Ninth Symphony, consists of nothing but puzzling moments. It was composed just after the end of the Second World War, so everyone was expecting Shostakovich to deliver a properly weighty and triumphant utterance. What they got was something which launched off in a scandalously perky mood. Gardolińska was determined to play up to that, with a jauntily fast tempo and ear-rasping trombone and piccolo. Then came one of Shostakovich’s typically abrupt emotional switch-backs, with a long lament for two clarinets which – in this performance at least – emerged as dignified and objective, rather than heart-rending. The third movement took us back to the jollity of the opening movement, but now with a sharp and sardonic edge, emanating mostly from the superbly brazen sound of the orchestra’s principal trumpeter, Chris Avison. Gardolińska seemed to be taking us on a journey of ever-increasing polar opposites, through the doleful tuba and bassoon of the fourth movement, and onto the manic rush to the end. It was a convincing view of this puzzling piece, and a brilliantly exciting end to a concert which had more than its share of slip-ups along the way."
culture,,,,,"While last week’s Line of Duty   saw many of its record 9.6 million viewers fixated on the show’s bewildering acronyms (in particular, the rude-sounding  ), talk of the   was of Jimmy Savile.  As anti-corruption unit AC-12 looked into the murder investigation of journalist Gail Vella, they watched videos of her past reporting - which played rather like a  , but with some queasy real-life policing chucked in.  In one clip, Vella (Andi Osho) covered the conviction of former chief superintendent  , an unmasked member of a VIP paedophile ring who we last saw in series three of the drama. Jed Mercurio courted controversy then by including a doctored image of Fairbank and another suspect, local politician Dale Roach, alongside the real-life sex offender Jimmy Savile. But Savile wasn’t actually name-checked in the show until last night. In her report, referencing the cover-ups perpetrated by figures like Fairbank, Vella said: “It’s now a matter of public record that Jimmy Savile cultivated relationships with senior police officers” - accompanied once again by that image of Savile with Fairbank and Roach, blurring reality and fiction. Vella continued: “Savile exploited those relationships to intimidate anyone attempting to investigate his offending. We now realise what Savile was getting out of those relationships with senior police officers. What remains unknown - and uninvestigated - is what those officers were getting out of their relationship with Savile.” The explicit references to Savile shocked many viewers, who shared their uneasiness on Twitter. One commented “A Savile storyline? Poor taste to put it politely”, while another said: “Bloody hell, Mr Mercurio is going a bit bloody close to the bone with this one.” However, former chief prosecutor Nazir Afzal also took to Twitter, pointing out that “Jimmy Savile has been involved in more criminal conspiracies than anyone I’ve ever dealt with - real & fictional. No surprise he turns up in #LineofDuty.” Previously,   between the police and Savile, saying: “The fact is that Savile bragged of his close relationships with officers.” The series three storyline strongly evoked Operation Yewtree, and a subsequent investigation into links between organised crime and corrupt officers, in series five, had the very similar name of Operation Pear Tree. So, is Mercurio attempting some amateur detective work via his drama, in the vein of Serial or Tiger King? Or is he just using   to spice up the series? If the latter, he’s treading on dangerous ethical ground. It’s also a far cry from the   of Line of Duty, with its deliberately vague geographical setting (an unnamed city in the Midlands), fictional forces like Central Police, and clearly invented characters. That distancing allowed viewers to delve into the world of modern policing, while still enjoying it as a TV drama. But series six is inching ever more into our world - with uncomfortable results. It wasn’t just Savile who made a startling appearance last night. The late Vella’s producer told AC-12 that she was doing her own podcast, to reveal truths that she couldn’t get on air, and that she was inspired by the podcast on Daniel Morgan. Again, this is a blatant true-crime reference. The cited podcast -  , presented by Peter Jukes and brother Alistair Morgan - delves into the murder of the private investigator in 1987. It alleges that Morgan had uncovered major corruption and drug trafficking within the Metropolitan Police, and that he was killed to stop him exposing it. Morgan’s murder officially remains unsolved. There’s also the inescapable parallels between Line of Duty’s Vella case and the killing of   - including the police questioning whether the perpetrator was an obsessive fan (the accused Barry George in real life; Terry Boyle in the drama), or whether this was a professional hit job. Mercurio’s series has always had a basis in actual policing. The writer consults retired and servicing officers on his scripts, and scans anonymous police blogs. That’s evident in the series’ assiduous use of  , regulations, paperwork, and painstaking interviews.  But this latest series is much blunter about dragging in real-world parallels, making it jarring for viewers. There is still a certain suspension of disbelief needed to make Line of Duty work, and that’s at odds with its fictional journalist actually commentating on Savile. Vella also referenced series one’s corruption case, involving a counter-terrorism squad raiding the wrong flat and shooting an innocent man, then lying to cover each other’s backs. AC-12’s Superintendent Hastings, played by  , is particularly outraged that the unit’s commanding officer - who led the cover-up - was then “made chief”. The plot line is obviously inspired by the murder of Jean Charles de Menezes, who was wrongly identified as a suicide bomber by the Met and gunned down at Stockwell Tube station in 2005; in the aftermath, officers initially lied about their actions. So, is this Mercurio criticising the appointment of Cressida Dick - who headed the operation - as Met chief? Dick has also, of course, been in the news recently after her force’s poor handling of the Sarah Everard vigil. An unrepentant Dick has expressed outrage at Mercurio’s portrayal of “the level of casual and extreme corruption” in the police. And while the series isn’t a documentary, and makes no such claims, it does have certain responsibilities as a popular primetime BBC programme. Can Mercurio really make allegations about actual crimes and police officers via his show?  It might be just about acceptable legally - even, some might argue, a public service - but it’s dubious dramatically. If we’re meant to be viewing Line of Duty with the sober earnestness applied to the Dando, Savile or de Menezes cases, that’s a very different proposition to enjoying a Sunday-night thriller with some basis in reality, but which takes plenty of creative license. In short: it sucks the fun out of it. Start treating the realm of Line of Duty as one bound by the rules of actual policing, and the whole thing collapses. Of course our AC-12 team would have been disbanded by now, given their many and various misdemeanours (not least sleeping with an unending string of suspects and witnesses). Nor should they be investigating the unit where their former colleague, Kate Fleming, works. That’s a job for AC-1-through-11, surely. And series three’s   is utterly absurd if you place it in a real-world context. Mercurio should also take care that he doesn’t put the spotlight on his own actions. A telling line in last night’s episode, in reference to Vella, was “female journalists get the worst of it.” Well, they do from Mercurio, who attacked a Guardian journalist on Twitter in 2019 for daring to criticise his show and, speaking to GQ earlier this month, doubled down by calling her a c___. Opening up Line of Duty to serious scrutiny is a Pandora’s box. Mercurio might well regret it - and so will his viewers."

Jessie Greengrass’s The High House imagines England after a climate apocalypse
","
Cli-fi is a booming genre – does this predictable, conventional tale do enough to earn its place?
",Lucy Scholes,"
28 March 2021 • 3:00pm
","In her debut novel,  , Jessie Greengrass strung defining episodes in medical history into the story of her narrator’s decision to have a child. The result was a lambent, penetrating work only made all the more enticing by the promise of what the author would do next. Alas, The High House is everything Sight wasn’t: despite speculative elements and occasional flashes of luminous prose, it is a much more conventional, predictable tale. The high house sits above the waterline on an unnamed stretch of the English coast, some time in the near future. Below it lies a  , carnage of a meteorological event of unprecedented destruction. “Each year, between water and neglect, less and less of the village remains,” reports Sally, the first of three narrators. “Grass grows in tufts from walls. Silt covers gardens. Crabs run across broken cobbles of the road.” Unspooling backwards, we learn the genesis of this makeshift family – half-siblings Caro and Pauly, and their protector, Sally – alone at the end of the world, sifting through their grief and measuring out their solitary days in hard work: “This is what we do now. We dig and weed. We plant. We store seed, and we watch the weather for signs of frost.” It’s a quiet, uneventful existence – no marauding mobs threaten their fragile security, no unwelcome visitors assail their home – more hardscrabble rural idyll than blasted post-apocalyptic hellscape. The occasional glimpse of refugees plodding along a distant skyline is the only other sign of life. Greengrass isn’t adding to the more sensationalist offerings in the eco-dystopia vein; her interest lies in the relationships between her characters, and how they came to survive in the first place. Not that this provides much in the way of action or tension either, because her narrators display little agency of their own. Francesca – Caro’s stepmother, who had Pauly when Caro was 14 – is the puppet master pulling the strings. A climatologist, she fortified the smallholding in preparation for the coming flood. Unquestionably the most intriguing character here, she is portrayed as an enigma, described only through the eyes of others – a risky gamble that doesn’t quite pay off. Here’s a woman who has dedicated her entire life to shouting about “the imminently coming end of our f---ing planet”, yet we’re supposed to accept that, during this, she decides to get pregnant? “It was a kind of furious defiance that had led her to have a child, despite all she believed about the future,” explains Caro, “a kind of pact with the world that, having increased her stake in it, she should try to protect what she had found to love.” I know it’s meant to sound rousing, but I didn’t buy into what is essentially a soundbite of empty sentimentality – which is problematic, as it’s the central premise upon which the novel is built. It stands in confusing contrast to the supple elegance of Greengrass’s engagement with motherhood in Sight. There, she flexed form and structure to build meaning in a layered, more intuitive way, a skill that has considerable potential in the  . Take Jenny Offill’s Weather, its fragmented structure mimicking her narrator’s experience of everyday anxieties rubbing up against overwhelming fears about “the coming chaos”. Or Madeleine Watts’s The Inland Sea, which evocatively cross-pollinates a classic coming-of-age narrative with a new type of real-world ecological horror story. Even Carys Bray’s ostensibly more conservative When the Lights Go Out uses the backdrop of a dying world to explore the particulars of a declining marriage, while Rumaan Alam’s Leave the World Behind (although not strictly cli-fi) did something interesting with the classic disaster novel trope by creating a post-apocalyptic chiller comedy-of-manners hybrid. There’s no such inventiveness here. There are, however, moments of beauty: the weeks of summer heat feeling like “living in a headache”, or the way the protagonists cling to each other like a tangled “knot”. Greengrass is also chillingly articulate when describing our wilful blindness in the face of the initially creeping, then cascading inevitability of disaster: “Somehow, while we had all been busy, while we had been doing those small things which added up to living, the future had slipped into the present.” Ultimately, though, The High House doesn't feel like it amounts to anything new."

What's next for pop and rock: a live music boom and a fight for the industry's soul
","
As part of our series on the future of culture post-Covid, our music critic foresees the culmination of a battle between artists and Spotify
","Neil McCormick, ","
10 March 2021 • 5:00am
","Covid-19 exposed fault lines in the popular music business. As the live sector ground to an economically devastating halt, one that threatened to destroy livelihoods, the recorded music sector enjoyed a streaming boom that patently failed to benefit the vast majority of music makers. One side appeared to be rolling in wealth as it threw, via social media, a year-long lockdown dance party for homebound consumers, while the other side was queuing up at food banks and railing against a fundamental, systemic imbalance of remuneration between creators and monetisers. This may be an age-old tension, but the effects of the pandemic brought new pressures to bear: it threw economic disparities into sharp relief and raised questions about whether the very structure of the music business was fit for the modern world.  As the immediate crisis passes, venue doors creak nervously open, underemployed musicians tune up their instruments, road crews pick up tools again, and fans get their glad rags and dancing shoes on, the big question is: has anything really changed? Is the music industry ready to address the deep inequities that have come to light during this long, strange year, or will everyone be so relieved just to be back on the beat that we’ll dance our troubles away, and hope for the best? In a few months’ time,  , sitting in theatres, or leaning against bars being bombarded by sound and lights and music (sweet music!). It should start with small venues opening at the end of May, followed by some big outdoor events as the summer heats up. A few brave (or foolhardy) festivals are determined to press ahead in August,   against the potential losses were a new strain of Covid to blow everything off course. By the fourth quarter, arenas should be booming to the sounds of the world’s greatest rock and pop stars, some desperate to replenish their coffers, others just desperate to strut their stuff again. There could yet be setbacks and delays. We may have to show vaccination passports at the doors to gain admission. I don’t expect venues to be as jam-packed as in days of yore. Caution and social distancing will remain priorities for many, and for some time to come. Of course, others will be ramming themselves into the heart of spontaneous mosh pits with devil-may-care abandon as soon as they’re allowed – or even if they’re not.  The appetite for young people (in particular) to get back into the fray has been demonstrated by the number of illegal raves breaking out during the past year, and once that party really gets started, it’s going to go off in all kinds of unpredictable ways. But across all age groups, there has been a patient acceptance of postponements (with low levels of concert ticket returns, as 87 per cent held on to purchases), alongside a healthy surge in sales since the Government announced its roadmap to recovery. Britain is not just ready to rock – it’s desperate to do so. A live boom is on its way. By 2022, there will be so many popular musicians on the road that revellers will be spoilt for choice. Live Nation, arguably the world’s largest events-promotion conglomerate, expects to have 45 major artists touring, when it would usually field half of that. The company lost 84 per cent of its revenue in 2020, but is planning for 2021 to be its busiest year, with Britain’s advanced vaccination programme putting us in the vanguard. “On a global basis, the show will be back,” according to CEO Michael Rapino. “It’ll be back as big as ever, [thanks to] consumer demand.” This is good news for fans, and a lifesaver for musicians. One thing that lockdown has made savagely clear is that live performance is the key income stream for the majority of working musicians. Time and again, we have heard tales of penury and hardship, even from household names. David Crosby, a world-famous American singer-songwriter and founding member of two beloved bands (folk rockers The Byrds and harmonising quartet Crosby Stills Nash and Young) sold off the rights to his entire catalogue last month, declaring “I can’t work, and streaming stole my money.” His music was bought by Iconic Artists, one of a new breed of aggressively acquisitive music focused investment funds much in the news. Market leaders    , Blondie, Nile Rodgers and Barry Manilow;  , meanwhile, sold his catalogue to Universal for over $300 million. By treating copyrights as long-term investments, such funds present themselves as artists’ champions, but others view them as asset-strippers exploiting the inequities of the current rights system. It’s a trend sure to gain further momentum over the coming months, as more big names take a pay-day, but one that only benefits established artists while contributing nothing to the long-term creative future of music. The online #BrokenRecords campaign started by Tom Gray, a member of British indie rockers Gomez, has gained significant traction by highlighting the microscopic royalty payments that streaming services such as Spotify, Apple Music and YouTube (owned by Google) pay to rights holders. Musicians and songwriters complained of being at the bottom of a digital food chain, receiving fractions of a penny for each song, with even those tiny dividends effectively being divided between multiple band members and songwriters after record companies have made all kinds of contractual deductions. At the heart of the controversy were complaints about a “winner takes all” system, based on market share, that only delivered substantial payments to superstars and supersized record labels; 78 per cent of Spotify’s royalties are paid to major labels and the major independent rights body Merlin. It caused enough of a stink to inspire a British parliamentary inquiry into the economics of streaming. The heads of record companies and streaming platforms queued up to declare that it was a perfectly fair and equitable system, and it wasn’t their fault if artists had negotiated such poor deals for themselves (I’m paraphrasing). They came across as mean-spirited and obstructive when confronted with the emotional testimony of members of   and Elbow, who spoke passionately on behalf of impoverished musicians and unemployed crew members. The critically-acclaimed, Mercury Prize-nominated, festival-headlining indie singer-songwriter Nadine Shah revealed that she’d had to move back in with her parents during lockdown because she could no longer pay her rent. To industry protests that the streaming system was perfectly transparent, Shah retorted: “What is transparent is that I am not being paid.” The truth is that this fight has been brewing for a decade. Streaming has replaced CDs, vinyl and even downloads as the mass-market distribution method of the digital online era. No one disputes that it is convenient and effective, with consumers paying monthly fees (or enduring the irritation of free advertising-supported models) to receive unlimited access to pretty much anything we want to listen to, all beamed directly to our devices. After more than a decade of decline, streaming has restored the recorded-music industry’s fortunes, and returned it to healthy growth, with a global streaming market estimated to be worth $26 billion in 2019. The pandemic thus accelerated existing trends, with everyone stuck at home eager for entertainment to while away the endless hours. The Record Industry of Association of America noted a 14.6 per cent growth in on-demand music services during the last year. Spotify alone added a billion euros’ worth of premium revenue as subscriptions boomed. Major labels are said to earn as much as $20 million a day from streaming.  But as Covid devastated the live industry, what became cruelly clear is that streaming’s trickle-down economics are not trickling down to the people who actually make the music. There are over 8 million artists touting their wares on Spotify, but just 7,500 earned $100,000 in 2020. That is just 0.09 per cent of musicians on Spotify, meaning: pretty much every recording musician in the world. And even that dismal figure is misleading, because it doesn’t account for profit division among bands and fellow rights-holders. “Streaming has been built by corporations for profit margins. It hasn’t been built with any sustainable cultural remit in mind,” is the view of Tom Gray, who argues that this is a historic opportunity for fans, players and industry alike to right some systemic wrongs. “It’s about collectively saying: we all recognise that this is problematic. We all recognise that this was never really right, and surely we’re all bright enough and dynamic enough and willing enough to do something about it.” What is emerging is a powerful grassroots argument for higher royalty rates, fairer record and publishing contracts reflecting new digital-distribution realities, and a user-centric payment system that connects listener’s fees directly with their favourite artists, rather than dispersing profits on the blunter market-share system. The latter is something we will be hearing a lot about in the coming year, as SoundCloud (a relatively small but significant streaming service) announced its adoption of what is being described as “fan-powered royalties”.  Some really big stars are getting involved here, lending a moral dimension to the campaign, since they are objecting to a system that has personally enriched them. “I want my (streaming) subscription to go to the people I play,”   of Abba insisted during the recent Radio 4 Front Row programme, The Price of Song. “With user-centric, you could be a niche artist with 3,000 loyal followers, and if they play you, you get all their subscriptions, which means you could actually live off that. But as it is now, it all goes to those mega artists who have billions of clicks. And that is one thing we could change. It’s completely unfair.” I expect this to become an ever more public battle over the next year, a struggle for the soul of the music industry. One possible consequence will be to greatly energise and empower a genuinely independent movement, where creators opt to retain all their own rights, supported by breakaway streaming platforms and a more artist-friendly network of independent music services. The major labels, with their huge budgets and global marketing reach, may continue to dominate the mass market, but it has been striking how many genuinely independent British artists reaped the benefits of loyal fanbases this past year. There were big chart-topping hit albums during lockdown for such fierce rock bands as Idles,  ,   and Architects, and uncompromising grime artists ,   and  .  When venues throw their doors open, who are those all-important young audiences going to be most desperate to see? Someone with a cute viral hit from an algorithmically-driven Spotify playlist – or the kind of artists who have struck deep bonds with fanbases through bloody-minded commitment to their art? If you add the kind of bold creative energy we see in the independent sector to a fan- and artist-driven campaign for change, then put it together with a revitalised live scene driven by the pent-up frustration of a young audience desperate for visceral thrills and human connection, it unlocks all kinds of thrilling possibilities. And this is my fondest hope for the future, that something will emerge that no one could have predicted: a new scene, a new style, a new attitude, a new way of doing business rather than a return to business as usual. There will be plenty of the latter, of course. What I can say with certainty is that there will be a dam-burst of new albums from all our favourite established stars in the next 18 months, and celebratory gigs from the biggest name in every popular musical genre. It’s going to be a good year ahead for music, wherever your tastes lie. But I’m also looking nervously and hopefully at the horizon for something fresh, something youthful, challenging and radical that might push music out of its comfort zone, scare the horses, rattle established practises, rewrite the rules, and shake the whole business to its foundations, whether we like it or not. Maybe it’s just a dream, one of those feverishly over-stimulated pandemic visions that have haunted so many of us this past 12 months. But wouldn’t it be satisfying if the end of lockdown offered pop music a whole new beginning?"
culture,,,,,"With the year-delayed London mayoral election just over a month away, there’s one question it behoves anyone who cares not only about theatre but about the city itself to ask: what plans do the main candidates have to breathe life back into the  ? It may not sound like an agenda-topping query, given the reams of other policy areas. But that theatrical activity is a significant economic good (aside from its immediate benefits to social and emotional wellbeing) is beyond dispute; approximately 15.3 million audience members visited   in 2019, a million more than attended Broadway shows. Apart from the VAT spin-off of ticket sales (£133 million), the stimulus to the wider service and leisure sector – restaurants, bars, hotels – habitually runs into millions more. As far back as 2004, a study commissioned for the Arts Council estimated that the economic impact of West End theatre-related expenditure was £1.5 billion per annum. Times have seldom been tougher for the capital. Consumer spending in central London by overseas tourists was £7.4 billion lower throughout 2020; domestic tourists spent £3.5 billion less, and commuters £1.9 billion less in 2020 than in the previous year. One forecast suggests the annual economy of central London could contract by £36 billion by 2031, if home-working remains the norm, and no substantial targeted action is taken. If anyone had needed ocular proof that when Shaftesbury Avenue goes dark, the centre of town becomes a desolate place, last year provided irrefutable evidence; and, likewise, as theatre valiantly mounted a brief resurgence  , the attendant throng and recovery of seeming normality was palpable. Yes, London’s businesses are affected en masse by Government restrictions – both in terms of closing down and opening up – but the pivotal role played by theatre is manifest. Although Government and theatre sector alike are continuing to work behind the scenes to ensure that a robust comeback accompanies the  , there’s plainly room for City Hall to do its bit to support and stimulate activity. What track record for meaningful engagement can Sadiq Khan lay claim to, and what initiatives, if any, have he and his main rival Shaun Bailey set down ahead of May 6? It might be worth turning in the first instance to the thespian in the pack. Does   of the Reclaim Party have anything to offer? His media team didn’t respond to a request for information, but an indication of his thinking came during a debate aired on March 25, in which he told a panel of guests: “I think once we have reclaimed our freedoms from the authoritarian chaps we [should] have one day in London where every theatre performance is free, paid for and you just send the bill to the mayor - that’s what you've got to spend money on, get people out there again.” He has also said: “I think that the theatres should never have closed... because the evidence is coming in that lockdown is not an effective policy.” Make of that analysis what you will, but at least he has a tangible proposal, however sketchy. Sadiq Khan’s manifesto will be launched in April. Prior to the pandemic, he flew the flag capably for culture in the capital, snapped attending theatrical first nights and presiding over such measures as the Cultural Infrastructure Plan and Creative Land Trust (finding affordable space for creatives). Since Covid hit, he made £2.3 million available through the Culture at Risk Fund to offer support to musical and theatre venues (via the Theatres Trust).  In August, he asked the Government for more financial support, including for the freelance workers theatreland depends on, warning of an “existential threat” to the West End. In December, he joined the Prince of Wales and Duchess of Cornwall at the Soho Theatre to highlight concerns. And this March, he announced that £6m would be invested in supporting the re-opening of the London economy, £2m of which will be spent on campaigns designed to woo visitors and tourists back. The challenge for Khan, however, is a lack of public-facing, eye-catching initiatives and the risk even of his embarking on visitor-deterring policies. In December, it was reported that he had asked Transport for London to look into the feasibility of charging drivers £3.50 to enter the capital (having faced down Government proposals for a Congestion Charge zone expansion). When you compare his stance with can-do utterances by New York Mayor Bill de Blasio, who has revealed plans for a Coronavirus vaccination site on Broadway and dedicated resources to help theatres reopen in the autumn – declaring “It’s time to raise the curtain and bring Broadway back” – Khan’s rhetoric sounds overly muted. Charismatic contender Shaun Bailey has made strides asserting his ambition to tackle crime, transport and housing issues. Some of his past statements about multiculturalism and integration, single mothers and benefits, and the value of having teachers who were “men”, won’t have endeared him to many in or out of the arts. But if, over the month ahead, he can build on some of the ideas his team have floated to the  , he may still be able to present himself as an energetic figure of cultural renewal. If elected, he plans to create a “West End Weekend Pass” for one weekend this summer, “a one-day pass which allows you to use the London transport network for free”. These will be modelled on the 2012 Olympic Games Oyster cards given to those accredited (a scheme that reportedly involved 370,000 cards at a cost of £10.25 million). Further ahead, he promises “an annual Festival of London, beginning in Summer 2022”, modelled on the   – “to encourage tourists and Londoners alike to attend musical, theatrical, and comedy performances”. “The Mayor’s office will provide grant funding, infrastructure and advertising aid,” his team has suggested. Fine, as far as it goes... Elsewhere, the Green Party’s Sian Berry has come up with the idea of a £33m pilot scheme for a “Creative Autonomy Allowance” which will see a thousand “young people receive a regular basic income for three years”; it borrows from a Thatcherite template – the “Enterprise Allowance” (est 1982-3) which enabled then young “working class people… to support themselves as they strived for creative and freelance careers.” Perhaps all of the above ideas would help – and a marriage between Khan’s visitor-focussed pragmatism and Bailey’s proposed festival would be of use. What’s needed, though, is something well-planned, robust and visionary, and near ready to go. In this respect, all the candidates are lacking the zeal to kickstart the capital through culture and help flood theatregoers (safely of course) back into the West End. The most trenchant analysis comes from Nickie Aiken, Conservative MP for the Cities of London and Westminster: “The biggest issue we’ve got in getting people back into the West End is transport. We’ve got to ensure that commuters and visitors are confident of getting back on the Tube, otherwise they won’t come back in. We won’t get substantial numbers until September but we will get a trickle. Whoever the mayor is has to ensure the transport system is fit for purpose and that people feel it’s safe.” She continues: “The West End is on its knees. It will bounce back but it’s going to be slow because it relies so much on commuters and international visitors. The next mayor has got to hit the ground running in encouraging the domestic market, because that is what is going to provide the beginning of the recovery. “I’m a Conservative, so I’m rooting for Shaun Bailey to win. I think he understands how important the West End is for the London economy and the UK economy. But with whoever does win, I would hope that on day one of their new mayoralty they will launch a plan to reopen the West End safely, so we can do that as soon as possible in June."" She seizes on Khan’s recent announcement that London would be  “joining forces with Berlin, New York and Paris to... share data and ideas” and his open call (from June 1) to “innovators and entrepreneurs to come forward with new ideas”. “That’s another task force. He’s very good at setting up task forces, but can we just get on with it? We don’t need more roundtables. The time for talking is over – we now need action.” My own two-pennies-worth? I’d like to see some radical thinking with swift practical benefits. Like the establishment of bicycle-parking facilities in the heart of the West End (with security) to allow those who’d like to avoid the transport network to come under their own steam. An outdoor festival of musicals this autumn too. And a campaign to encourage young and first-time theatregoers to try the West End, via supported deals. Above all, I think if the Government fails to come up with an insurance scheme, imminently, that provides producers and investors with the confidence they need to plan to reopen, at scale, from the autumn, in accordance with the roadmap, then City Hall should step in. Would that entail millions? Very likely. Should it be time-limited,  to ensure the means to get the West End to early next year? Very possibly. But if I were a candidate I’d be devoting time to building this into the core of my campaign, and resolving to bring together the industry’s movers and shakers the minute I set foot inside City Hall, to forge a cultural ‘war cabinet’. This isn’t about frittering money away on non-essential arty items, it’s about critical investment: re-igniting the engine room of the creative industries and doing everything to ensure that the West End, and thereby the capital, comes out of the pandemic with something to shout (and maybe also sing) about."

What’s next for dance: post-Brexit bullishness, but fears of a lost British generation
","
As part of our series on the future of culture post-Covid, we look at how this artform has seized the political microphone
",Marianka Swain,"
11 March 2021 • 5:00am
","As with so many artforms, the dance industry has seen a  , as live shows attended by audiences have given way to work on screens, watched at home. “They’ve become an integral part of our programming, rather than an add-on,” says David Nixon, artistic director of Northern Ballet. That change might have happened over the next few years, but Covid “has catapulted it ahead”. Online, the offering has largely ranged from archive productions to  . The last of these, to my mind, have proved the most effective as a viewing experience, since they’re specifically designed for that medium – and our couch-bound attention span. “I’m not sure people want to sit in front of full-length ballets at home,” Nixon agrees. “The energy and focus in the theatre keeps people engaged.” Post-pandemic, I’d hope to see more practitioners making a virtue of the digital turn, as that’s what the best ones have done this past year: we’ve had the wit of Corey Baker’s Swan Lake Bath Ballet, the ingenuity of Sophie Laplane’s Indoors, the hard-hitting provocation of Jonzi D’s Our Bodies Back. They reached viewers nationwide and around the world; they connected with those who wouldn’t think of going to dance houses, or couldn’t afford to. It’s a way for dance to sell itself to new audiences – not always its strongest suit. “People often say ‘I don’t like ballet’,” Nixon says, “but they’ve never actually seen it. They just think of tutus and men in tights. Part of our job is to get a broader audience to understand that the menu has changed. Some of our online pieces are almost short films first, dance second.” This might be a way to close the gap between TikTok crazes and Swan Lake. “Perhaps there’s an audience that isn’t interested in sitting in a theatre, but will watch our work on an iPad.” The problem, as ever, will be financial. As an alternative business model, digital “is not yet realistic,” says Tamara Rojo, English National Ballet’s artistic director and lead principal. “We’re a company of 70 dancers and 60 musicians. We need to perform in theatres.” Unfortunately, that’s still a way off: the Government’s roadmap has venues reopening no earlier than May 17, and with full audiences – theoretically – in June. And companies such as ENB also need to know whether they can tour productions any time soon. That’s a major way of democratising dance: companies bring it to your local theatre, and at a reasonable price. National tours involve moving easily around the UK. “Will we be allowed to do that?” Rojo worries. “Dance is a people-heavy art form: a big classical ballet means a full company, musicians, backstage workers. We’re paying for travel and hotels. It’s expensive.” Beyond our borders, too, there are worries about travel arrangements. Normally, ENB’s national tours make a loss, but they’re subsided by their international ones. The latter are more profitable, Rojo explains, because “those producers have bigger budgets, and we can form commercial partnerships, or perform at high-paying festivals.” Might this mean raising UK ticket prices, at least while social distancing is still in place? It’s an adamant no. “We supply thousands of tickets for as little as £12. That’s part of our mission.” And when audiences come back, what will they see on stage? Dance isn’t usually the most reactive artform, since productions have such long lead-times. Recently, though, the best works have shown new boldness and urgency. Last October, for example, I was moved by Will Tuckett’s Lazuli Sky for Birmingham Royal Ballet, a one-act piece that drew on our rediscovery of nature during lockdown. Nixon doesn’t feel as though he needs to put Covid on stage just yet: “Maybe in a year or two, when we come back to reflect on it.” But Rojo thinks some work is ripe for fresh resonance: her forthcoming Florence Nightingale-inspired reworking of Petipa’s Raymonda will honour the nursing profession. Rojo herself is an optimist: she reckons we’re going to see “an artistic renaissance” post-pandemic. Sadly, it won’t involve everyone. Some have already left the industry, hit by the triple whammy of no work prospects, no financial support and the loss of intensive physical training. Dancers, at this level, are akin to Olympic athletes: dormancy is lethal. It’s also tough on students and emerging artists, cast into a punishing job market with few professional opportunities. How many can stick it out? Are we in danger of losing our next generation of talent? And given closed borders and post-Brexit visas, one might worry that Rojo’s “renaissance” will be too UK-focused. Dance is such a collaborative form, led by international choreographers. Nixon is cautious: “We have fantastic British dancers in the company, but lots from other countries too. You don’t grow in isolation – you need to be fed by what’s out there.” But if anything, he believes, Brexit “will push us even more to collaborate and reach across borders”. After all, dance is a universal language. Rojo agrees: “Anybody can look at it and feel something.” In her view, we should take pride in the fact that British companies are in such demand all over the world – something that isn’t going to change. One positive consequence of the pandemic has been a lasting change at the political level: this artform – so often overlooked – is now firmly on the agenda. Rojo thinks of her position at ENB as “an honour and a great responsibility. Speaking out for the arts, lobbying the Government – it’s given me more conviction.” She now advocates the introduction of a living wage and better job security. With dance taking its rightful place centre-stage, the prospects really are exciting. “We’ve sustained everyone through lockdown,” says Rojo. “We drive the recovery of other sectors, and we help give the UK its identity. “We know how many doors the arts can open. That’s going to be more important than ever.”"

What’s next for opera and classical music: digital concerts and intergenerational war
","
Continuing our series on the future of culture post-Covid, our classical critic looks at a new drive for localism amid the effects of Brexit
","Ivan Hewett, ","
9 March 2021 • 5:00am
","Classical music and opera in Britain have faced crises before – two world wars, plagues, government bans during the Cromwellian period – but never anything as bad as  . And yet, long before the pandemic struck, these ancient and inherently traditional artforms were already in difficulties. Both suffer from aging and shrinking audiences, and a cultural and political climate increasingly hostile to “elitism”. In response, they’ve been taking steps to renovate themselves. “Diversity” and “accessibility” are now the keywords, aims which are sometimes hard to square with other values – the need to preserve a core repertoire of masterpieces, for example, or to produce radical and “challenging” art. The early signs are that the pandemic has accelerated existing trends, perhaps beyond the point of no return. With venues closed, and income streams from live audiences cut off, institutions have been forced to be innovative. Many have embraced the challenge of   live and pre-recorded concerts, though the economics of this are dubious; with ticket prices pitched between £7 and £12, the income stream is modest compared to ticketed live concerts. Nonetheless, digital performances are here to stay. Dougie Scarfe, chief executive of the Bournemouth Symphony Orchestra, says the vital thing has been to stay visible. “We wanted to say to our audience: ‘We are here for you.’ And we wanted to get back to employing musicians as well. So we built our stage to allow 50 musicians to play with social distancing, and we put on a complete season of digital concerts. I think the pandemic has accelerated our move into the digital sphere by about five years.” Jenny Jamison, chief executive of the Scottish Ensemble, had to cope with even stricter lockdown conditions than those imposed in England. “We could only do outdoor concerts, and even those were cancelled. This encouraged us to move into digital presentation, which we’d been thinking about for a while but never had a quiet moment to work on. We worked with two production companies, because I believe it has to be a different sort of experience than just reproducing a concert. We also had to move all our education work online, and by doing that we reached 150 schools, which is many more than we could ever reach in person.” Still, when you ask whether their changes will be permanent, the “yes” is always followed by a “but”. The insistence on the importance of the live event is a mantra one hears again and again. “I love the spontaneity that comes from working on really short time-frames, which the pandemic necessitated,” Jamison says, “and it would be a mistake to lose the new skills we’ve acquired. But nothing can replace the live event.” But what will those live events involve? Will institutions need to be more cautious in their programming, to win back their traditional audiences? Jamison says no, but in Bournemouth, Scarfe is more circumspect. He’s keenly aware that other values are at play. “I’ve had letters from audience members saying that just seeing the BSO on stage on their screens every Wednesday gives them a comforting feeling of normality. But of course the social dimension is missing. I really want to get out on tour again, because our concerts are a social experience as much as a musical one.” When I ask whether the orchestra will have to be more local in its choice of invited artists, as a consequence of both the pandemic and Brexit, the answer is “no, but”. “We are an international business,” he says, “and we want to draw on the widest pool of talent. But it’s true there is an administrative burden of extra red tape, and extra costs for touring projects.” In the  , one finds the same tension between wanting to capitalise on the new ideas thrown up by the pandemic, while hanging onto a core artistic mission. Some companies have been really bold, none more so than English Touring Opera. It has made a filmed version of the St John Passion involving amateur choirs from all over the UK, and a series of filmed small-scale performances called Lyric Solitudes, which are bold dramatisations of song cycles. James Conway, ETO’s director, is enthused by the idea that opera will become more local in terms of both performing talent and artistic identity. “I really dislike these touring international co-productions, where the same production turns up in six different cities. For me, it’s the operatic equivalent of the airport duty-free shop’s luxury brands.” Will the digital aspect of ETO’s work continue? “Absolutely, but as a supplement, rather than displacing live performance. For me, that offers something irreplaceable.” The company has taken a big financial hit, but when I ask whether recovering from that will necessitate a more cautious programming policy in the future, he’s adamant. “No way. It’s an illusion that that’s a safe way forward, because there is no safe. If we just present La Traviata and Madama Butterfly all the time, it’s nothing more than a temporary fix. In the end it will be the death of the art form.” That’s the view of a small, nimble-on-its-feet touring opera company. You’d expect a flagship company like the Royal Opera, however, to be more cautious about artistic policy in the future, given the sheer size of the organisation, and the cultural role it’s expected to fulfil. When I ask chief executive Alex Beard whether the new mantra of “make it local” could apply at Covent Garden, he’s as circumspect as Dougie Scarfe in Bournemouth. “Up to a point, but I think here there will be always an expectation to see the very greatest artists in the flesh.” Meaning: we’re still willing to pay top dollar for Jonas Kaufmann and Anna Netrebko. With only 20 per cent of the company’s income coming from subsidy it’s taken a terrible financial hit, and has had to resort to redundancies and selling off assets including a David Hockney painting. Are there any silver linings? “My feeling is this pandemic has brought the arts community together in a way that’s never happened before. For example, every Friday morning there’s a Zoom meeting where dozens of people who run arts organisations meet up to share ideas. That would never have happened before the pandemic.” What is difficult to predict is how the deeper currents of values and meanings expressed in these traditional artforms will change. Will there be a huge upsurge in love for the core classics, as audiences crave comfort and security? Or will the move to new technologies breed radically new forms? In my opinion, and to judge by what I hear, it will be both at once: the fragmentation that’s already visible is going to accelerate in the coming years. A once-unified field could end up divided along different demographic divides: over here, “chill-out” or “healing” classics for younger audiences, in clubs or community centres; over there, defiantly traditional concerts and operas for older ones, in traditional venues. These divisions are more than demographic: they’re rooted in very different conceptions of what the words “classical” and “opera” actually mean. The struggle over who “owns” these artforms may become the defining feature of the post-pandemic age."

TINA, review: one of the most shocking, painful yet triumphant stories in rock history
","
In this moving documentary, the 81-year-old superstar bids farewell to showbiz, and reveals the pain and PTSD she suffered for so long
","Neil McCormick, ","
29 March 2021 • 8:32am
","“It wasn’t a good life. The good did not balance the bad,” says  , looking back on her extraordinary career in a powerful new documentary, TINA, directed by Dan Lindsay and T.J. Martin. At 81 years old, the iconic   superstar admits that she still finds it painful to think about her dramatic past, enduring physical, psychological and sexual abuse behind the spotlights. “The trauma is so deep that to go back there makes you feel that you are actually going back,” she says, describing a condition that her second husband, Erwin Bach, specifically links to Post Traumatic Stress Disorder. “If you don’t address the wounds of your past, you continue to bleed,” as Turner herself puts it. Turner makes it clear that this intimate film is intended as a final reckoning, a goodbye gift to fans before she returns to her clearly treasured quiet life of retirement in luxurious homes in Switzerland and France. “How do you bow out slowly?” she ponders. “Just go away?” Such is Turner’s self-created image of sensuality, strength and almost primal power, it is oddly disconcerting to first see her in her Eighties, sitting down to face the cameras. Her face is a little puffy beneath a soft fringe of brown and gold highlighted hair, and she is dressed demurely in an expensive dark suit, looking every inch a wealthy, sweet little old lady. But as the film intercuts with thrilling, dynamic archive footage of Tina in her prime, it becomes a treat to return to her contemporary self, apparently content, and full of smiles, laughter and hard-earned wisdom. “I lived a shameful life but I found a way to live with it,” she says, yet the smile on her face offers so much more: forgiveness, love, acceptance and the promise of contentment. Tina Turner’s story is, ultimately, a survivor’s tale. If this is, indeed, the last act, the documentary packs quite a punch. Slickly produced, at times quite flashy and schmaltzy (as was, to be fair, Tina’s musical oeuvre), it nonetheless digs into one of the most shocking, painful yet ultimately triumphant stories in rock history with real zest and flourish, and a determination to face the brutal truth. And it does it crammed with fantastic music and the kind of raw, sweaty, sexy, heartfelt performances that will make you wish this extraordinary singer was still out there, ripping up stages around the world. The facts of Turner’s life are well known, from books (including her best selling 1986 autobiography, I, Tina), films (1993 biopic What’s Love Got to Do With It made a star of Angela Bassett) and even a recent hit musical (2018’s multi award winning Tina was still running in the West End and Broadway before the pandemic). Growing up poor as Anna Mae Bullock on the cotton fields of Tennessee, she was unloved and abandoned by both parents, relying on the care of relatives before impressing band leader and early rock and roll pioneer Ike Turner with her singing aged 17. Ike renamed her Tina and made her a star (and Tina still manages some kind words about the more nurturing phase of their relationship), but he also married her to keep control of his protégé, beat her viciously, sexually abused her, and essentially tortured and imprisoned her before she made her escape after 20 years and several suicide attempts. “Maybe it was a good thing that I met him, that I don’t know,” the older, wiser Tina Turner ponders, contemplating how her life ultimately turned out. “It hurts to have to remember those times.” Tina had to give up all rights to their past music (including her own autobiographical song, Nutbush City Limits) and turn herself into a hard-working entertainment cabaret artist just to pay the bills and support their children (four boys, only two of whom were Tina’s, but all of whom she raised). The story could end there with a warm glow, but Tina’s tale boasts an incredible second act, perhaps the most extraordinary comeback in rock history, that saw her rise to global multi-million selling, stadium-playing superstardom in the Eighties, the only middle-aged female star of her magnitude in a notoriously sexist business. The documentary brings it all to vivid life, driving every point home with fantastic footage and revealing interviews that have strong resonances with the present struggles of female artists in the music business. It includes the raw and previously unheard testimony of Tina’s 1981 interview with People magazine, in which she first revealed that she was a victim of spousal abuse, describing her life with Ike as “torture.” Some of this testimony is difficult to hear, including a graphic account of how he would beat her with coat hangers until there were huge welts, then rape her, and then “make me get right back on stage and say ‘sing, you m***********, cause you made me do it.’” These revelations from such a glamorous, strong and famous figure helped pierce a veil of silence around abuse. Tina Turner can be viewed as a pioneer of the #MeToo movement, even if the second act of her life perhaps softens the horrors of those early years. Yet there are huge complications in grappling with such material that a two-hour life story can barely even scrape the surface of. production of River Deep, Mountain High in 1966 is depicted as a pivotal moment for Tina as an artist, offering a glimpse of creative musical freedom that when Spector bribed the controlling Ike to stay out of the studio. Tina describes it as “like a bird getting out of a cage.” But Spector’s misogynistic murder of Lana Clarkson in 2007 makes him an uncomfortable figure in the role of liberator. And it is left to vintage footage of Ike to explain the inherent industry racism that ensured River Deep, Mountain High was a flop in America, while it went on to top charts in England and Europe and remains acclaimed as one of the greatest records ever made. Ike Turner is certainly depicted as the villain of Tina’s tale, yet the documentary does hint at the structural and social racism that helped twist and poison his personality, ensuring this brilliant musical pioneer rarely got the breaks or appreciation his talent warranted. Nonetheless, it skirts over the fact that Ike Turner was never truly cancelled, as might be expected in the modern day, being inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1991, and winning his fifth Grammy award in 2007, the year he died (bitter and unrepentant) aged 76. There is enough in the early years of Tina Turner’s struggles to warrant a mini-series, let alone just half of a two-hour documentary. The second half of the film is dedicated to Tina’s fantastic comeback, driven by the bravura physicality of her charismatic performances, and that incredible, raw, throaty, richly emotional voice. By illuminating the emotions behind the scenes as Tina struggled towards shedding “the fear and guilt”, even the most over-slick 80’s musical performances are lent rich extra dimensions, with a live version of The Beatles’ Help turning into an absolute showstopper. There are, inevitably, aspects missing from this telling of Tina’s tale. In particular, the film glosses over the considerable effusive support Tina always received from white, male rock stars, with The Rolling Stones, The Who, David Bowie and Rod Stewart all being instrumental in helping her regain the spotlight she deserved. It goes unmentioned that Bowie encouraged his record company Capitol sign her in 1983 (although it does note an unnamed Capitol executive describing her as ‘an old n***** douche bag’). But veteran rockers are perhaps an understandable omission in a documentary that focusses on Tina’s significance as a black female icon, with Oprah Winfrey appearing to remind us “nobody talked about sexual abuse, physical abuse, domestic abuse, abuse period. Our generation is the generation that started to break the silence.” The fact that Tina herself still finds it difficult to talk about the abuse is driven home in clips from TV interviews across her career, showing the expressions that flit across her features as she is repeatedly reminded of the worst years of her life. Practising Buddhism gave her the strength to leave Ike, face her demons, and eventually love herself enough to find love with a sweet, shy and mild-mannered German record executive, 16 years her junior. “My heart went ba-voom!” she delightedly recalls of the moment she met Erwin Bach in 1986. “It means that a soul has met.” “It’s love … it’s an electrical charge. I still have it that feeling, it’s in my heart,” says her husband, 35 years later. The couple display a touching contentment that might just leave you with a tear in your eye after the tumultuous, violent, emotionally wracked depiction of Tina’s wild life. It is a tale that really does go river deep, mountain high."

When cinemas, theatres and art galleries will reopen after lockdown
","
As part of the easing of the third lockdown, the government has announced the return of indoor entertainment from early summer
",Telegraph Reporters,"
29 March 2021 • 5:41pm
","measures have begun to be gradually lifted, as some degree of normality returns over the spring and summer. There will be four phases to the easing of restrictions, but where do the arts fit in? Indoor performances will resume on or around May 17, as part of Step Three of the Government’s plan, with capacity  limited to up to 1,000 people. Normal outdoor performances of up to 4,000 attendees, as well as seated outdoor performances for up to 10,000 attendees, can also resume. Larger indoor performances will be back no earlier than June 21, as part of Step Four. The Prime Minister also suggested that rapid testing might be introduced as part of the return of larger performances. Hairspray at the Coliseum is  scheduled to open to the general public in June, while Andrew Lloyd Webber’s Cinderella and The Prince of Egypt will open in July. Some other big West End shows have postponed their planning openings for this year, including Sister Act, Frozen, and Get Up, Stand Up: The Bob Marley Musical.  Social distancing will remain in place until at least June 21. It has a decisive effect on whether shows are financially viable or not, since it reduces the audience capacity dramatically, in some cases to one-third or less. Most shows need around 70 to 80 per cent of seats filled merely to break even. As a result, if social distancing continues into mid-summer or later, many venues might delay re-opening, as they work out whether they can actually afford to keep putting on shows with reduced audiences, or whether it’s best to wait and save their resources for now. Inside the auditorium, audiences should expect most Covid precautions to remain in place – such as compulsory mask-wearing during performances, the use of e-tickets and card payments rather than cash, one-way systems and frequent use of hand sanitiser. It is not yet clear whether venues will require any proof of vaccine, or will continue to do temperature checks at the door as they did in 2020. Drive-in cinemas can reopen from April 12, while indoor cinemas will return on May 17 or soon after. The range of films on offer will most likely feel bare compared to pre-Covid times but song-delayed blockbusters including  , starring Tom Cruise, Hamilton creator Lin-Manuel Miranda's musical In The Heights, and Marvel's Black Widow, which have all moved to mid-summer releases, will capitalise on the timing. The much delayed Bond film,  , however, is unlikely to brought forward from its current November date. The experience for cinemagoers will likely be similar to 2020. Most chains were maintaining social-distancing measures across all areas within the cinema, and offering hand sanitiser to all ticket holders and employees, while toilets were stocked with anti-bacterial hand soap and staff had been given stringent hand-washing guidelines. Since last year, booking systems have been updated to allow friends and family to sit together while ensuring a safe distance between customers from different households in the auditoria. Start and end times for films were being staggered to regulate crowding, and one-way systems operated throughout the buildings. Face coverings were mandatory. Museums will be able to re-open from May 17; while art galleries were not specifically mentioned in the announcement, it is assumed that they will also re-open then. Jean Dubuffet: Brutal Beauty at the Barbican will open on May 17; Matthew Barney: Redoubt and Igshaan Adams: Kicking Dust at the Hayward Gallery will open on May 19. Major spring and summer exhibitions, like the V&A’s Alice, Whitechapel Gallery’s Eileen Agar and Tate Modern’s Rodin, are expected to open from the earliest possible dates. Mask wearing, limited advanced booking and social distancing measures will remain in place until at least June 21. Indoor concerts of up to 1,000 attendees, outdoor performances of up to 4,000, and seated outdoor performances of up to 10,000 can resume from May 17, while larger indoor and non-seated outdoor performances could be back from June 21. Pilot events to gauge the feasibility of that timescale will be running from April. This looks like excellent news for summer music festivals. While Glastonbury had to cancel its 2021 plans, many other major events, including Reading and Leeds, The Isle of Wight, and Wireless, have  Thanks to bubble systems and regular testing, many shows resumed production in 2020 and have continued into the new year. Last May, the BBC, ITV, Channel 4, Sky and other British broadcasters agreed a set of guidelines for the safe operation of sets, and these are expected to remain in place for the time being."

Deaccessioning: why museums are selling their most valuable treasures
","
Covid has left cultural institutions worldwide facing penury. Must they cross the red line and send their best-known paintings to auction?
","Alastair Sooke, ","
30 March 2021 • 5:00am
","How can museums survive the financial apocalypse brought about by the pandemic? Last summer, the popular Canadian journalist   suggested a fix. In an episode of his Revisionist History podcast, he asked: why do big institutions cry “help!”, and complain about deficits, but refuse to sell their treasures to drum up cash? The Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York, for instance, has more than 1.5 million objects, mostly held in storage. “All they would have to do is pick a couple of things off the shelf [and sell them], and they would never see a deficit again.” Fast-forward to today, and it seems that Max Hollein, the director of the Met, who heard Gladwell’s podcast, was swayed. Recently he announced a controversial change in policy regarding “deaccessioning”, as selling objects from museum collections is known. But deaccessioning is not the silver bullet Gladwell would have us believe. Indeed, his argument turns out, on reflection, to be simplistic and misleading. As it happens, museums in America (unlike Europe) regularly deaccession objects, and have done so for decades. Typically, they follow strict protocols, such as offloading duplicates, or hanging onto recent donations and works by living artists. Moreover, proceeds are ring-fenced for future acquisitions. As with a garden, you occasionally need to chop down dead wood, but then you plant something new. Today’s controversy stems from last spring, when, in light of the pandemic, the Association of Art Museum Directors (AAMD) – the sector’s de facto watchdog in the US –  d its deaccessioning guidelines. Until April 2022, it announced, it would refrain from punishing institutions that sold art “to pay for expenses associated with the direct care of collections”. In other words, American museums were given a two-year window to cover operational costs by flogging stuff they owned. This may seem esoteric, but, for many observers, it was potentially a line-crossing moment. After all, “collection care” is vague. Curators’ pay: surely legitimate. But what about, say, a leaking roof? Moreover, if deaccessioning becomes the norm, won’t potential donors be less likely to gift things in the future? So far, several museums have taken advantage. For instance, New York’s Brooklyn Museum has raised almost $35 million by auctioning off works including a Lucretia by Lucas Cranach the Elder and a Monet landscape. Meanwhile, the Baltimore Museum of Art, which had hoped to raise $65  million by privately selling a Last Supper by Andy Warhol and auctioning its only paintings by Brice Marden and Clyfford Still, only changed tack at the last minute, after two former board chairmen reportedly threatened to rescind $50 million in promised donations. In February, though, when Hollein announced that the Met would also consider deaccessioning to fund “collection care” (he was facing a revenue loss of $150 million), all hell broke loose. His predecessor, Thomas P Campbell, now in charge of the Fine Arts Museums of San Francisco, denounced the move on Instagram: “Deaccessioning will be like crack cocaine to the addict – a rapid hit that becomes a dependency.” Writing in Apollo magazine, he added: “The AAMD has acted with the best of intentions, but opened a Pandora’s box… I fear these institutions will face increasing pressure to monetise their most valuable works.” Yet, for Hollein, who spoke to me recently over Zoom, the “slippery-slope” argument is an overreaction. He says that suspending the AAMD’s guidelines – a move Campbell worries could become permanent – is a “temporary measure”. In a typical year, Hollein explains, the Met raises around $15 million from deaccessioning, which goes towards new acquisitions – on top of another $50 million, from restricted endowments, earmarked for the same purpose. Given the crisis, it is reasonable, he suggests, to temporarily divert this $15 million to staff salaries – especially when, thanks to those endowments, he still has tens of millions of dollars at his disposal to grow the collection. Moreover, he insists, the Met has no intention of cashing in on major works: “We would never sell a Michelangelo, or whatever… It’s not as if the collection is being drained.” He points out that much of the collection is held in storage because it includes more than 1.3 million fragile, light-sensitive photographs and works on paper, and rejects the argument that, instead of sanctioning deaccessioning, the museum’s billionaire trustees should themselves be giving more. “We have a super-generous board,” he tells me. Still, what works for the Met will not suit other institutions – especially in Britain, where the culture regarding deaccessioning is very different. The British Museum, for instance, boasts a collection of around eight million objects. Only 53,000 are ever on display in Bloomsbury (though thousands more are usually on loan elsewhere) – but the British Museum Act forbids trustees from getting rid of any object unless it duplicates another, is damaged, or deemed “unfit to be retained”. (Exceptions are also made for certain types of objects such as human remains.) According to the museum’s policy, “the trustees… do not normally deaccession objects”. It’s a similar story at the National Gallery, though admittedly its collection of around 2,300 paintings is considerably smaller. While it has a policy governing “disposal” in “extenuating circumstances”, a spokeman recalls only a single example, from the 1990s – when, in line with the 1992 Museums and Galleries Act, which permits objects to be transferred between national institutions, several drawings were handed over to the British Museum. Yet, according to former museum boss Charles Saumarez Smith, “there have been periods of deaccessioning” in the UK: “Actually, lots of things have been deaccessioned over the years.” And now, it seems, advocates for the practice may be gaining followers on these shores, too. Consider the Royal Academy of Arts, which, following the rejection of its application to the Government’s Culture Recovery Fund, has shed more than a quarter of its workforce. “Are we out of the woods?” asks its chief executive Axel Rüger, looking grim-faced over Zoom. “Not by a long shot.” The RA is known for temporary exhibitions, which, in ordinary times, provide around a fifth of its total revenue. But it also has a permanent collection, consisting mostly of so-called “diploma works”, donated by artists – and, exceptionally, a circular marble relief by Michelangelo, valued at more than £100 million, which happens to be the Italian’s only sculpture in Britain. Last autumn,   that the RA should sell it, to avoid laying off staff. But, Rüger tells me, deaccessioning the Taddei Tondo (as the relief is known) was, and remains, a red line. “Ultimately, my task is to ensure the survival of the Royal Academy,” he says. “And the Royal Academy is not just a building. It is also the collection that I have been entrusted with.” The trouble is, he explains, that “to make a real difference, you have to sell the crown jewels. Selling fourth-rate objects is not going to generate the kind of money we need right now. And you can only sell something once. When it’s gone, it’s gone.” In 1962, Rüger reminds me, “the Academy sold the ‘Burlington House Cartoon’ by Leonardo, which is now in the National Gallery.” The sale raised a lot of money. “But,” Rüger continues, “has that been the ultimate liberation of the Royal Academy? No, it hasn’t.” Museums shouldn’t consider their masterpieces as “financial assets”, he adds. Clearly, then, there is “good” deaccessioning and “bad”. Furthermore, all the back-and-forth is part of a bigger debate about what museums, fundamentally, are for. Should they always be striving to expand? Or is it valid simply to look after what they’ve already got? For decades, Rüger says, museums have enjoyed “almost unbridled growth”. But now, he explains, “for us, the principle is sustainability”. Ultimately, he sees himself as a “mere custodian” of the RA: “And, when you’re in our business, the purpose is to preserve it – to hand it back, hopefully, in slightly better shape than you found it, but, at least, unscathed and undamaged, for future generations.”"
sport,,,,,"The achievement of Rachael Blackmore in riding six winners at the Cheltenham Festival and being crowned leading jockey there was one of the  I just wish for her sake there had been a crowd there – she (and Henry de Bromhead) would have been carried shoulder high across the paddock and, by Friday, up the high street. As a jockey she seems to have everything but, above all, a tactical awareness and versatility possessed by few others. When she won the   I made the point that we should no longer make the distinction between male and female jockeys – as she herself wishes - and I absolutely stick by that. But I am still wondering whether Blackmore is just very good or the distillation of four decades of females trying to break through? The answer is probably a bit of both. Forget females as professional jockeys for a moment, it should be remembered that until the end of WWII, all stable staff were men and it was not until the 105th running of the Grand National, in 1951, that the winner of that race was led up by a girl for the first time. So, in the time that it takes to grow a reasonably sized oak tree from an acorn, the sport has gone from all male to where we are now; a majority of stable staff are female and  . When I was riding, from the start of the 1980s, it was at roughly the same time as the early pioneers; Lorna Vincent, Diane Clay, Tarnya Sherwood, Susan Kersey, Ryan Moore’s aunt Candy Morris, Penny Ffitch-Heyes and my younger sister Gee who had had a double at the Cheltenham Festival in 1987 before I had virtually had a ride at it. (Annoyingly – younger sisters are not meant to do that). But those early pioneers crashed a few planes trying to prove themselves on bad horses. Jayne Thompson died six days after a first fence fall at Catterick in November 1986 without ever coming round. Jessica Charles-Jones was paralysed from the waist down, aged 23, at Southwell while Sharon Murgatroyd was paralysed from the chest down when her mount fell at the last hurdle at Bangor, trying to get the horse round so that she might keep the ride on it next time, in 1991. Those two spent the rest of their truncated lives in wheelchairs. Jessica died in 2010 and Sharon in 2014 – both before their time. From a very close-knit, small pool of female riders that was a high strike rate of catastrophic injuries and, I guess, when they come to write the definitive history of female jump jockeys it will say that as a breed they took 10 years to recover and it was not until Nina Carberry and Katie Walsh started coming over in the 2000s and winning at Cheltenham that they started to really get going again. “I’m embarrassed to be described as a pioneer for Rachael Blackmore,” says my sister, Gee Bradburne who hides the videos of her racing from her children because, she reckons, she looks so awful. “She’s in a different league. We just held on to the mane and kicked like hell. She’s reaching the sky, I was ambitious but one of my ambitions in those days was to get a working shower in the girls’ changing rooms at every racecourse across the country! “I remember at Worcester our changing room was a corridor, with no windows, beside the owners and trainers bar. When Princess Anne came to ride they put in a carpet and catering but it was slightly disappointing when we went back the next time that both were gone. But, in a way, you can’t blame the racecourses – there were never more than two or three of us and there wasn’t the demand. “But I always thought if there was a girl who was good enough being a woman wouldn’t stop them – even in those days. It was always injuries or mistakes that stopped us, just as it stops a lot of the lads who don’t make it. At that stage there wasn’t a girl who rode well enough. A few hit the scene for a short time but none of us stood the test of time.” If anyone was looking down and smiling on Blackmore last week it would have been Jayne Thompson, Jessica Charles-Jones and Sharon Murgatroyd, the women who paid a big price for their pioneering spirit. "

British Cycling and Ukad insist they will cooperate with Wada investigation into 2010 drugs test 
","
The emergence of the sample is likely to lead to further searching questions for both Ukad and British Cycling
","Tom Cary, ","
28 March 2021 • 7:56pm
","British Cycling and UK Anti-Doping say they are trying to assist the World Anti-Doping Agency’s enquiries after an investigation was launched over the weekend into allegations Ukad allowed British Cycling to carry out its own internal probe into a rider's sample, which allegedly contained traces of a banned anabolic steroid.  Ukad is said to have informed British Cycling of the sample, which dates from the autumn of 2010 and allegedly contained traces of a metabolite of nandrolone, with British Cycling then conducting its own internal follow-up, using a private laboratory, HFL Sport Science in Cambridgeshire, to run tests on four riders. Lots of teams and governing bodies run internal screening programmes. It is allowed as long as there is full transparency with Ukad and results are shared and it is done to Wada standards. Any positive test and Ukad takes over.  According to the Mail on Sunday, the Cambridge lab said in an email to British Cycling that it had received permission from Ukad’s then head of legal Graham Arthur to run the tests. However, Ukad have so far found no record of a conversation between Arthur and the head of the lab. And it is still unclear whether Ukad ever saw the results of the tests which were carried out. There is also concern over an alleged email from British Cycling’s then   to the riders who took part in the testing asking whether they would be happy to cooperate, with the lab “reporting only to myself and [then head of medicine] Dr Steve Peters and NOT Wada or UK Anti-doping…”. A Wada spokesperson described the findings as a “significant concern” adding that it had asked its independent Intelligence and Investigations Department to look into the matter. Ukad is understood to be confident it acted within Wada guidelines and strongly objects to the suggestion that it “tipped off” British Cycling over the initial test. On the contrary, it was not unusual to inform a governing body of a sample showing trace findings as they are below the threshold required to investigate and could indicate a health issue concerning the athlete in question or some other innocent explanation, for instance a contaminated supplement. Ukad can, of course, use the trace sample to target-test the athlete in question over the next period. British Cycling said the departure of key personnel in the intervening period made an investigation challenging. ""We are unable to give full comment on this story at this stage as the events took place over 10 years ago and none of the senior management team involved have worked for British Cycling for some time,"" it said in a statement. ""We are reviewing such archived records that exist from this period and, although that is not a straightforward or quick process, we will share the findings with the relevant parties."" Ukad, for whom current chief executive Nicole Sapstead was then Director of Operations, is attempting to find evidence of the authorisation Arthur allegedly gave to the Cambridge lab, as well as evidence that it followed up on the tests themselves, all of which returned negative. ""We are working with the World Anti-Doping Agency to investigate claims relating to private testing carried out by British Cycling in 2011,"" said a spokesman. ""Ukad is examining archives to confirm decisions that were taken in 2011 followed due process set by Wada."""

Grand National 2021: When does the Aintree race start, what TV channel is it on and how will it work during Covid-19?

Race times, schedule, full list of weights and latest odds for Grand National 2021
",Telegraph Sport,"
30 March 2021 • 8:58am
","The Grand National is back   It is the best known steeplechase in the world in which 40 runners tackle the daunting obstacles of Aintree's 30 Grand National fences over the course of four and a half miles. The National is the highlight of Aintree's Grand National meeting which this year runs from Thursday April 8 to Saturday April 10. The main event will be on Saturday as things stand.  However, as our racing correspondent Marcus Armytage reports, that date could be put back in the light of the Government announcing its four-stage plan to move out of lockdown: The runners will go to post for 5.15pm.  Aintree Racecourse, which has hosted the race since 1839. The racecourse is situated approximately six miles outside of Liverpool.  Live coverage will once again be on ITV1. Alternatively, you can bookmark this page and return on race day to follow all the action on our dedicated live blog.  The race was cancelled due to March's announcement of a national lockdown in response to the coronavirus pandemic. In its place was an animated virtual Grand National shown on ITV, won by 18-1 shot Potters Corner. Punters will be pleased that the living, breathing animals are back this time.  The final field of 40 runners is yet to be selected and won't be confirmed until the week of the race.  For now, click on the underlined words that follow to read the   as it stands. All of the horses will be assigned a weight by the British Horse Racing Authority Head of Handicapping in February. The handicap system is simpler than it sounds, and is designed to create as close a race as possible. The better horses carry the most weight while the outsiders carry the least. Each horse has an OR (official rating) and this will largely determine the weight they carry. , after he was rated just one pound off the top weight held by Bristol de Mai, Santini and Easyland. His Gigginstown owners described that eight as 'unfair'. The Aintree fences are not quite as perilous as they were once upon a time after a series of alterations. However, they are still the most notorious obstacles in the business and enough to make the palms of any jockey sweat.   The sixth and 22nd fence in the race may not be the biggest, but it's difficulty comes from the fact the landing side is 10 inches lower than the take off side. Named after Captain Martin Becher, a jockey who fell at this stage and hid in the brook to avoid injury.   Named after a horse that allegedly jumped it backwards in 1840. More likely, the horse spun around in mid-air to create the optical illusion that its hind legs landed first.  The tallest fence on the course now stands a five foot three inches.   One of the smaller fences is named after the 100/1 shot who avoided a disastrous pile-up here in 1967 and went on to win.  As the name suggests, horses must take a sharp turn to the left after jumping this five foot obstacle. Another Aintree myth is that horses used who refused to turn ended up in the Liverpool and Leeds canal. "
culture,,,,,"“Gentle” is a warm and wonderful adjective. It’s what we crave from a touch or a reminder: something kind, light, amiable, free from harshness or violence. So why, when a comedy is described as “gentle” today, does it often sound dismissive, even derogatory? I’ve been writing radio and television comedy for nearly 35 years. Initially, if critics, broadcasters or friends described any of my comedies as “gentle”, I was miffed. But that isn’t the case any more. Great comedy is often challenging, and sometimes that means cruel. Take, for instance, The Thick of It, where strings of joined-up expletives are hurled by characters who appear to hate each other. Or crude, like   or  , full of what my grandmother used to call “unparliamentary language” and puerile jokes. It doesn’t mean they’re not funny, but it does mean that they exclude a large swathe of the viewing public who prefer their comedy with less vulgarity and more wit. Gentle comedy, by contrast, is defined by kindness. Yes, the characters may bicker but there is love and affection. In the last year, stuck indoors under the same roof, we’ve wanted TV shows the whole family can enjoy without someone being embarrassed or appalled. And nostalgia has proved the way forward. Channel 5 whisked the new  l out from under the BBC’s nose; niche TV channels such as Talking Pictures and Forces TV spotted the need for a “comfort watch” and streamed vintage comedy, including Rumpole of the Bailey and my own long-running series Second Thoughts. Another hit, , conveyed a feelgood likeability in its recognisable depiction of the shorthand and warmth of long friendships. It isn’t even a scripted comedy: it’s an eavesdrop on two old friends, each recovering from serious health problems, talking and laughing, while one teaches the other to fish. We want to be by the river with them. We want to be their friend. Each generation has a “marker” comedy and can recite whole scenes from their favourites, whether it’s  ,  ,  ,  , anything written by  ,   films or . When I was young, we’d quote whole chunks of radio’s   on the school bus. The characters we love best have a vulnerability, visible through their bluster. My favourite line from Galton and Simpson’s   is when, as chairman of the jury, his ignorant but hilarious summing-up begins: “Magna Carta! Did she die in vain?” He is like Captain Mainwaring (Arthur Lowe) in   and David Brent ( ) in The Office: these characters see themselves very differently from how the world sees them. When, in The Good Life, that uber-snob Margo reads aloud a Christmas-cracker joke – “the Ooh Aah bird is so called because it lays square eggs” – her husband Jerry and neighbours Barbara and Tom fall on the floor laughing, but Margo is almost tearful: “Why is that funny, Tom?” Even if the characters are not related, there’s often a “family” element. In Dick Clement and Ian La Frenais’s sitcom  , the old lag Fletcher (Ronnie Barker) keeps a protective, fatherly eye on his younger cellmate, Godber (Richard Beckinsale). “Next year, Rodders, we’ll be millionaires,” the ever-optimistic Del Boy tells his brother in John Sullivan’s   but then Grandad whacks the wrong bolt and the chandelier crashes to the ground. Both those writers invented swear-word substitutes – “scrote”, “naff off” and “plonker” – and reached a much wider audience. In comedy, accidents and disasters happen far more frequently than in real life – and are miraculously resolved or forgiven by the episode’s end. No matter how many times we watch  , Victor Meldrew will pick up a dachshund instead of a phone. We know what’s coming, but it makes us laugh every time, often because we recognise the characters’ traits: “He/She is just like my mum/my boss/my best friend!” In The Canterbury Tales, Chaucer was conveying nobility and strength – not soppy weakness – when he described a “verray parfit gentil knyght”. Gentle comedies can be quietly strong, too. Their audience may not even realise that the writer has addressed serious issues such as class and prejudice with humour, as in the ground-breaking Goodness Gracious Me’s great line, “Going out for an English”. Across more than 200 TV and radio comedy scripts, I’ve tackled everything from bullying, anorexia and adultery to ageing, the menopause, heartbreak and death. Of course, comedy is never “one size fits all”. One day we fancy the slapstick mayhem of The Young Ones; another, the marital tension of Ever Decreasing Circles. In turn, we expect our broadcasters to offer us a kaleidoscope of comedy experiences. In the mid-1990s, I told the BBC’s then-head of TV comedy about my latest idea for a series: “Next of Kin is about grandparents bringing up their orphaned grandchildren.” After a few moments’ thought, he replied: “I’ll have six.” Twenty-five years later, that decisive autonomy and creative confidence has given way to algorithms. I’ve heard “what we’re looking for” edicts and buzzwords such as “noisy”, “cut-through” and “edgy”. The comedy commissioning landscape is now like a “webinar” from John Morton’s sublime comedy about BBC management,  . Thank goodness, then, for radio, the birthplace of a great variety of comedy from The Navy Lark and Round the Horne to After Henry and Ed Reardon’s Week. I had wanted to write a comedy for   ever since I saw her in 2005’s lovely, languid BBC Two series, Sensitive Skin, in which she played a restless wife, unwillingly relocating to the city with her husband (Denis Lawson). So for Radio 4, I wrote Conversations from a Long Marriage for her and Roger Allam, about a couple who met in the Summer of Love but – unlike in so many tetchy and toxic marital series – still love, respect and fancy each other. I’m now writing series three – and, yes, I’m happy if you call it “gentle”."

Unforgotten is everything that Line of Duty is not – understated, subtle and believable
","
Chris Lang's slow-burning thriller never tries to get one over on its audience, but shows the world in all its varying shades of grey
",Ed Power,"
30 March 2021 • 10:36am
","Nobody will forget   in a hurry.  ’s cold case thriller drew down the shutters in wrenching fashion as DCI Cassie Stuart (Nicola Walker) succumbed to the life-threatening head injuries she had suffered in that car crash the previous week.  And yet the big twist was that there was no twist. At least not in the manner in which Stuart was wheeled off-stage. It had clearly been final curtains for her ever since a stolen SUV clattered into her vehicle seven days earlier. The show was honest with us to the end. At least until Stuart's end - ITV has announced that Unforgotten will continue into a fifth series, with Sanjeev Bhaskar's DI Sunny Khan partnering up with a new detective. Whether the show, brilliant as it is, should continue without Walker is an argument for another day. Now is time to reflect on the achievements of a whodunnit which never tried to outfox the viewer and was more interested in the humanity of its characters than in convoluted plotting or death-by-acronym.  You can see where this is leading. Comparisons with   are inevitable. And yet the gulf between the two blockbuster capers is vast. One is a celebration of cleverness for the sake of cleverness and of storylines that have the quality of a snake swallowing its tail.  And then there is Unforgotten, which pays the audience the compliment of never attempting to get one over on them or demanding they spend half their viewing time checking Wikipedia entries from previous seasons.  Take the final scene of last week's Line of Duty, in which a fleeting shot of a bearded man in a car had viewers scrambling to work out exactly who he was. Had we seen him before? Was he significant? Was he - bizarrely - Neil Morrissey? All of this soared over my head: without Twitter I wouldn’t have even suspected.  No such deep delving is required of Unforgotten, a drama with two feet firmly planted in the real world. The other great insight Lang brings is that people are comprised of varying shades of grey and are rarely black and white.  Who is the all-time top villain on Unforgotten? There really wasn’t one, was there? Certainly not this season, where four now middle-aged former police college classmates conspired to cover up the killing of a hoodlum. The plot was rooted in ambivalence. Matthew Walsh, the victim, was a sexual predator and a lout. This was not to suggest he deserved his fate of death-by-fountain pen. Rather, it was Lang’s way of acknowledging the contradictions encountered in everyday life. Sometimes good things happen to bad people. Sometimes bad things happen to good people. And sometimes bad things happen to bad people. It’s just a roll of the dice. The suspects were similarly neither heroic nor wicked. Dean Barton (Andy Nyman), the killer, had desperately wanted to escape the shadow of his criminal family. Ram Sidhu (Phaldut Sharma), his intemperate pal, had been shaped by society’s hardwired racism.  Fiona Grayson (Liz White) was another sort of victim: she had become a policewoman in response to pressure from her father. And Liz Baildon (Susan Lynch) was an overachiever dragged down by happenstance. Her crime was to be in the wrong place at the wrong time.  Contrast this with   where baddies abound and where character development is closer to a Marvel movie than to classic British thriller tradition. That was confirmed by the absurd season five subplot in which upstanding Ted Hastings ( ) was briefly dangled as the mega baddie. Suddenly, he went from jolly “haud your wisht” banter to ominous scowls and creepy padding about with a laptop under his arm.   is the precedent here rather than the crime milieu to which Unforgotten belongs. In Line of Duty everyone speaks in arcane lingo – much as the Starks and Lannisters did – and there is little sense of a world beyond the “Here Be Coppers” realm of  ’s plotting. It’s fun – sometimes deliriously so. But it is very much its own self-contained thing.  Everyone is either a police officer, “bent” or otherwise, or somehow plugged into the shadowy wider conspiracy. Can you imagine, for instance, an exchange in Line of Duty similar to that in Unforgotten in which Sunny Khan challenges Stuart to recall the year in which Marathon bars were re-named Snickers? On Line of Duty it would probably be referred to as a “BRBOC” (""Bafflingly Renamed Bar of Chocolate"") and we would be left to our own devices trying to tease out what they were banging on about.  “If I had to define the essential DNA of Unforgotten, it’s that good people can do bad things,” Lang told the Sunday Times recently. What he’s getting at is that the show stands as an acknowledgment of human decency and fallibility. Just as in real life, there are no heroes or villains – merely ordinary individuals muddling through. Perhaps that is where its power resides: it holds up a mirror to the audience and confronts us with the reflections gazing back. "

","Set up in 1913 by journalist Karel Van Wijnendaele, the Tour of Flanders — or   as the locals say — is the biggest day in the Belgian sporting calendar and has been described as being like the Boat Race, Royal Ascot and the FA Cup final. All rolled into one. The race itself, the second of the season's five monuments following Mila-Sanremo, originally departed from Ghent, the spiritual home of Belgian cycling, though over the years its route has changed. In an effort to discourage spectators heading to the race due to the ongoing coronavirus crisis, organisers have not released a map or profile. The fifth, final and most prestigious race of Flemish Week is on Sunday April 4, 2021. The 105th edition of the Tour of Flanders is 263.7 kilometres long.

Meet the power couple saving local theatre from collapse
","
Howard Panter and Rosemary Squire have just acquired 11 regional venues in a new deal. It's a statement of faith for the struggling industry
","Dominic Cavendish, ","
30 March 2021 • 5:00am
","Despite the playhouses remaining closed, and uncertainty still rife as the mid-May prospect of live shows slowly advances into view, a husband and wife team often known as UK theatre’s “power couple” have delivered a morale-boosting vote of confidence in the future of British theatre. The Telegraph can exclusively confirm that late on Saturday afternoon,   and Dame Rosemary Squire acquired 11 regional theatres, an unmistakable affirmation that the sector will bounce back. “I think this deal is a real statement of faith in our industry, and the resilience of the sector,” the latter tells me. Given lockdown, there was no quaffing of bubbly or enthusiastic handshakes for those involved – just a few exchanged champagne glass emojis. The exact details, in terms of the financing involved, are being kept off-limits. But at a stroke this makes their relatively new company Trafalgar Entertainment Group the second largest theatre-operator in the UK. The organisation takes its name from the West End playhouse they have run since 2016 –  the newly named Trafalgar Theatre, (formerly Trafalgar Studios). The venues they’ve acquired (from Qdos Entertainment group’s subdivision HQ Theatres) include G Live, Guildford, the Wyvern Theatre, Swindon, Crewe’s Lyceum and the Churchill in Bromley. They represent the nuts and bolts of mainstream activity that give the industry its buoyancy in normal times, whether that be musicals, plays, comedy shows, or concerts. The Group's combined capacity is about 15,000 seats a night, potentially about 5.5m seats a year. Regional theatre tends to attract a much keener sense of loyalty from its potential audiences than do the often grander (and pricier) venues of London’s West End. While that can lead to assumptions about parochial tastes, the less glamorous side of the sector could be in pole-position to roar back as the public looks to nearer destinations for its cultural fix, keeping transport health risks at bay.   Is there a snobbery towards regional theatre? “Yes, I think there is,” says Panter, 71, on a video call from their marital home in Surrey. “But we know that people who live in High Wycombe are as interested in culture as people who live in Kensington. We also think that there’s scope for more people to come to regional theatres than currently do.” Their commitment to regional theatre is total. “We’re driven by the thought – why shouldn’t people out of London have the best?” he says. Those familiar with the business side of British theatre will know that Panter and Squire, 64, previously founded the UK’s biggest theatre operator, Ambassador Theatre Group (ATG), which now runs more than 50 venues in the UK, US and Germany. “I think once you’re an entrepreneur, it’s in your DNA,” Squire says. “You could describe us as serial entrepreneurs.” Panter – a bearded, ebullient, somewhat larger than life figure beside his quiet, thoughtful, sometimes inscrutable spouse – points to the economic rationale behind this new venture. “We’re not being naïve. The pent-up demand for tickets to productions we’re involved with has been remarkable, given the uncertainty about when we’re coming back and how safe it’s going to be. People are saying: “I want to go out.” And we’ve been driven by this continual belief that theatre will come back.” Squire grew up in Nottingham, finding early inspiration in Richard Eyre’s trailblazing regime at the Nottingham Playhouse in the mid-1970s, and gaining experience in administrative roles in London’s theatreland. Panter spent his early years in Australia, was educated in Dorset and cut his teeth in technical and stage management jobs. They met in 1979 via a theatrical flop – CP Taylor’s And a Nightingale Sang, which Panter was producing at the Queen’s (now the Sondheim), where Squire was working in the box-office. “No one came,” he laughs. “I mean nobody. It was a catastrophe.” She chips in: “He used to come and see the box-office returns and they were so pathetic that to ameliorate the stress he bought large G&Ts.” They married in 1994 (after Squire’s first marriage, to the literary agent Alan Brodie, came to an end). Both regard themselves as outsiders, and self-starters. As Panter puts it: “We didn’t come from money, we didn’t have a silver spoon in our mouths.” In the early days they even had to run their office out of a car parked near the Duke of York’s. He shudders at the phrase ‘power-couple’ – “Oh god, that sounds awful, a wee bit scary. We’re just a couple of people who are married who do theatre.” Such personal passion helps allay the fear that their empire-building is all about the bottom dollar. Some are suspicious of theatre chains, regarding them as top-down and squeezing the local character out of venues with their underlying corporate ethos. The pair robustly defend their track record at ATG in preserving the identities of each playhouse in their portfolio, and say this proves they’ll do the same this time around. “Each of the theatres here has a director rooted in the local community,” says Squire.  “We will not only be doing more producing in the buildings than has been the case but the shows we’ve produced will go more and more into them,” Panter explains. “We’re growing the business for audiences.” Squire indicates some could benefit from their streaming division, too – getting screenings of theatre, opera and the like. Given the apparent win-win situation, affability is the hallmark of their chat as the pair speak the day after the deal is done. But a slight irascibility creeps into Panter’s tone as he weighs up the miserly amount of government help that has been forthcoming, via the Culture Recovery Fund, for theatre’s commercial sector; in England less than one per cent of the £1.57bn has been awarded as grants to commercial theatre producers. “I think it’s terrible – it’s clearly inequitable for such a small amount of taxpayers money to go to the commercial theatre when that’s serving the vast majority of theatregoers. More than ever, and without any government-backed insurance, producers are taking a huge personal risk trying to kick-start shows. For them to be ignored because they’re not jewels in some metaphorical crown is not on!” He’s speaking on behalf of all producers but in the couple’s own case, he stresses, they’re not part of a super-rich, super-elite. “There are plenty of people who are a lot wealthier than we are. Most of our money is invested in our companies.” They’ve poured “millions” into keeping their enterprises afloat during the pandemic, and into the refurbishment of the Trafalgar Theatre. All being well, that will open, from July, with full audience capacity and the Sixties jukebox musical Jersey Boys. The regional venues will stir to full life in the autumn. Meanwhile, Squire lets slip that there may be further theatre news to follow: “We’re the preferred bidder on one central London venue we hope to be announcing after Easter.” We’ve been stuck in a gloom pit for so long, their talk seems to hail from a bygone time of sunlit optimism, which is where they’d like to take us. “By this time next year, hopefully we’ll be back to the good old days,” Squire says. And overseas markets, they say, are just gagging for our theatrical exports. Panter flies the flag: “We shouldn’t forget that we’re still considered the best in the world for theatre. Perhaps it’s all to do with Shakespeare but it’s held round the world that we’re really bloody good at it.”  "

More injury woe for Andy Murray as he pulls out of Miami Open
","
Scot keeps suffering hitches in attempt to re-establish himself as a regular presence on ATP Tour. Plus, why he will not give up the fight
","Simon Briggs, ","
23 March 2021 • 4:26pm
","Andy Murray has suffered another injury setback, forcing him to withdraw from this week’s Miami Open at short notice. The news is disappointing for a tournament that has already seen a rash of high-profile pull-outs, including the “Big Three” men and Serena Williams. But it is even more of a downer for Murray, who keeps suffering hitches   as a regular presence on the ATP Tour. The latest issue is some kind of groin strain which developed unexpectedly at the end of last week. “I had no issues while training,” Murray told  . “I felt fine, did some gym work Friday, no problem, and then I woke up about 3am, felt pain in the groin, not on the side I had my surgery, and when I got out of bed I struggled quite a bit to walk. “I have no idea what I did. It’s one of those freak things. Each day it has gotten progressively better, but it’s not enough. I have not practised since Friday.” Murray’s season thus far has included just three matches at tour level, and only one win - over Robin Haase in Rotterdam earlier this month. His frustration is all the greater after a promising pre-Christmas training block had persuaded him that he was well placed to compete. His first bad break was catching Coronavirus in early January - a misfortune which he blames on lax bio-security standards at the Lawn Tennis Association headquarters in south-west London. Even though he suffered no more than light symptoms, the illness still prevented him from boarding one of Tennis Australia’s dedicated charter flights to Melbourne. Now this latest niggle has ruled him out of a tournament he has won twice, in a city where he keeps a flat overlooking the bay. “I am really gutted,” he said. “This is a place where I have done so much training over the years. It’s like my second home. “I really just want to be on the court competing,” Murray added, in a separate interview. “I can't be bothered doing another eight or ten weeks of rehab. It's hard work and now I am finding it harder to get motivated to do all the rehab if I'm not going to be able to compete in the biggest events. That is why this one was like, f------ hell, just give me a break for this one event so that I can compete against these guys at a big tournament and see what I am still able to do.” From the sound of Murray’s comments, he doesn’t expect to be sidelined for long by this issue. Training could potentially resume soon, although the picture is complicated by Miami’s status as the last hard-court event before the tour moves onto clay. The next Masters 1000 tournament - Monte Carlo on April 10 - will probably come too quickly, given Murray’s intention to acclimatise to the clay with a dedicated training block. It has always been his least favoured surface, after all. But the Madrid Masters, starting on May 2, might represent a more realistic target. Or maybe one of the two ATP 250s the previous week - Munich or Estoril - which would provide a gentler level of competition. Either way, Murray remains eager for a chance to measure himself against the best. “I want to be on the courts at Wimbledon and feeling like I have a chance of winning the event,” he told  , in an interview screened last weekend. “I’m aware that that would be extremely tough, but I do genuinely believe it’s possible. “I’m sure some people will think I’m delusional and that my best days are behind me and everything - which may be the case. But I still feel I can compete with the best players in the biggest tournaments.”"

Screaming rows and threats to sue: How a humdrum tennis match turned ugly
","
The power struggle in men's tennis took a fresh turn at the Miami Open 2021 as Vasek Pospisil raged at ATP president Andrea Gaudenzi
","Simon Briggs, ","
25 March 2021 • 9:34am
","The growing tension between the ATP Tour and a group of dissatisfied players came to a head on Wednesday night as Vasek Pospisil — the leader of the dissenting group — exited the Miami Open amid an expletive-filled rant at chair umpire Arnaud Gabas. Unusually for an angry player, Pospisil was not complaining about a line-call — but rather about the ATP president Andrea Gaudenzi. “An hour and a half yesterday, the chair of the ATP f---ing screaming at me in a player meeting for trying to unite the players,” said Pospisil, after losing the first set against the USA’s McKenzie McDonald. “For an hour and a half. The leader of the ATP. Get him out here. F------ a------.” Gabas replied: “That’s enough. If you need to say something to him, then outside this court.” To which Pospisil said, “Why am I here? If you wanna default me I’ll gladly sue this whole organisation.” The outburst came after several days of meetings had failed to produce a united platform from which the players could challenge the ATP leadership. There have been gripes aplenty — about everything from prize money in Miami, which is down by 60 per cent, to the frozen rankings system and the protocols within the tournaments’ various bio-bubbles. As ever in tennis, though, it is one thing to identify the problems and another to fix them. This sport is a nest of interlocking systems — which might be a good thing if those systems worked together seamlessly. Unfortunately, as the former ATP chairman Etienne de Villiers said this week, “Everyone distrusts everyone else. To use a very eloquent Wordsworthian expression, it’s a ratf---.”  understands Gaudenzi made this very point to Pospisil when the two men met at a players’ meeting on the basketball court in Miami on Tuesday night, with an audience that also included ATP chief executive Massimo Calvelli. Gaudenzi and Calvelli had been at dinner when they were called in to see Pospisil by a couple of players. According to sources, the meeting can be summed up as Pospisil listing his grievances, and then Gaudenzi challenging him to give the solutions and asking if he really thought that tennis’s deep-seated issues — which were spelled out this week in a Bloomberg report — could be so easily solved. (The Bloomberg report suggested that the key problem lies in tennis “accounting for only 1.3 per cent of the total value of global sports TV and media rights, a smaller share than golf, hockey, or cricket”.) Who came off better or worse from the basketball-court meeting will be a matter of opinion. Almost everyone in tennis agrees the ATP leadership have been all but invisible during the Covid crisis. On the other hand, Pospisil seems to have been struggling to create a convincing alternative to the ATP’s admittedly distant way of doing things, and his explosion on the court can hardly be described as statesmanlike. As for the meeting itself, the Open Court website reported: “Gaudenzi and company really went after him [Pospisil]. They called him things like ‘ignorant’, ‘uneducated’ – lovely stuff like that.” Open Court reporter Stephanie Myles added that Pospisil was reportedly in tears afterwards and was still “shaken up” when he went on court. Pospisil posted an apology after the match on social media. “I want to sincerely apologise for my behaviour on the court in Miami earlier today,” he said. “I disrespected the game I love and for that I am truly sorry. By way of explanation, I felt deeply unnerved during a meeting between players and ATP executives last night, and I underestimated the toll those emotions took on me until I stepped onto the court today.”  to start a rival players’ organisation last year, the PTPA, which prompted Gaudenzi to warn: “it wouldn’t work and everyone would lose”. The PTPA remains low profile, but Djokovic and Pospisil left the ATP player council in August — along with leading American players John Isner and Sam Querrey — in order to set up the new body. During his pre-tournament press conference in Miami on Wednesday, Isner was asked if the players were disappointed with the reduced prize money. “It's not so much about the prize money,” he replied. “We don't really want to make it about that. Maybe it's about tour structure that the players would like to have a little bit more, I guess, better knowledge of as to why decisions are made, what went into making each decision.”"

'It needs to be penalised': Scourge of slow play clouds golf again 
","
Colin Montgomerie led the criticism after the slow conclusion to the WGC Dell Match Play, with Catriona Matthew also calling it 'pathetic'

29 March 2021 • 5:03pm
","As thousands of golfers returned to courses across England on Monday, a familiar row erupted amid the fallout to Sunday’s painfully slow WGC Dell Match Play conclusion. In the third consecutive all-American final, Billy Horschel recovered from an early deficit to beat Scottie Scheffler 2&1 at Austin Country Club and secure first prize of £1.3 million. Horschel had earlier beaten France's Victor Perez 3&2 in the semi-finals before Scheffler beat Matt Kuchar by one hole in a match which took four hours and eight minutes to complete in windy conditions. Colin Montgomerie led a chorus of criticism for what he deemed a “ridiculous” pace of play. “No one in front of them. Green reading books, lining up the lines on the ball. Really annoying me. And Matchplay is the fastest form of golf. Something has to be done,” he wrote on social media. In response to an image of both players and their caddies consulting their yardage books, Montgomerie added: “All four have their yardage books out. They’ve played the hole with practice nine times this week. Stood there for two minutes doing nothing! Slow play needs to be penalised.” Former Women’s Open champion Catriona Matthew also called the  “pathetic”. Closer to home, golfers throughout England celebrated the return of golf after three months of lockdown. Morley Hayes Golf course in Derbyshire opened at one minute past midnight, with players using neon golf balls for a seven-hole charity tournament to allow the action to resume immediately under the cover of darkness. Andrew Allsop, Morley Hayes Golf managing director, said: “It filled instantly, there was so much interest because I don’t think there are any places in England that do night golf and we obviously want to try and get in the records that we’re the first ones to reopen on March 29. “I think the buzz has been made even buzzier because it’s such great weather forecast this week. All the fair-weather golfers, everyone’s out and the tees booked from Monday morning first light, 6.30am, right through. It’s like that all week.” However, joy was not uniform across the country’s courses with  choosing not to open after it was unable to welcome more than 250 members due to a bizarre discrepancy between coronavirus regulations in England and Wales. The club, located five miles south of Oswestry, has 15 holes located in Wales and three in England. Welsh members of the club have been given permission to cross into England, but the rules have not been relaxed the other way, meaning English members are unable to travel into Wales. That left golfers who live just a matter of metres from the course’s entrance unable to resume playing on Monday despite the support of their local MP for North Shropshire, Owen Paterson."

Saul 'Canelo' Alvarez vs Billy Joe Saunders: when is the fight and what are they saying?
","
Bout between the Mexican and the Briton will be one of the boxing highlights of 2021
","Gareth A Davies, ","
30 March 2021 • 1:47pm
","Billy Joe Saunders, the unbeaten British fighter, is to face Saul 'Canelo' Alvarez in a super middleweight unification megafight. The bout is scheduled for May 8, the Cinco de Mayo weekend, at a venue yet to be announced. Miami, Dallas or Las Vegas are the three most likely locations. The four titles on the line are from the WBC, WBA Super, WBO and Ring Magazine. A win for Alvarez would leave him with IBF champion Caleb Plant to beat in order to hold every world championship at super middleweight. A win for Saunders would be one of the greatest British victories of all time. Alvarez destroyed the WBC's mandatory challenger, Avni Yildirim, in three rounds on Saturday 27 February, at the Hard Rock Stadium in Miami in front of 12,000 fans. Often referred to as the bad boy of British boxing, the Hertfordshire fighter comes from the traveller race and is undefeated as a two-weight world champion in a 30-fight career. He has been fined on several occasions by the British Boxing Board of Control for ill-discipline, and, just hours after the Alvarez fight was confirmed, appeared on Instagram wearing an apron with a fake penis, in a video from his training camp in Spain. “Canelo, I’m ready to rock and roll,” Saunders said. “You have to dare to be great and you aren’t going to be a great if you don’t beat the greats. I believe I am the only one with the footwork, knowhow, skillset, mindset and brain to unlock that door in Canelo. ""He’s the main man in the sport and the face of boxing. You have to give him respect, he hasn’t ducked anyone, he’s beaten good names, but nobody is unbeatable, and I believe I have got the tools to beat him if I use them properly. “I am looking at the golden ticket to cement my legacy, and that’s how you have to go in there to beat him. I’ve won everything from Southern Area to world titles. I could say ‘I’ve won it all, been to the Olympics, I’m unbeaten — I’ll see you later’. But I’ve only just turned 31, I’ve got no miles on the clock, haven’t taken any punishment — I believe he’s been in harder fights than me and has more miles, so I want to cement my legacy and beat him.” The Mexican is ranked the No 1 pound-for-pound boxer in the world. He is a world champion in four weight divisions from light-middleweight to light heavyweight. Saunders will be the  seventh British fighter to take him on; Alvarez’s victory over Turkey's Yildirim followed his triumph over Liverpool's Callum Smith in December. The youngest of seven brothers who have all fought professionally, Alvarez has gone 57 fights with just one defeat — to Floyd Mayweather Jr in 2013. He has acknowledged that in Saunders, he will face an accomplished and awkward southpaw. ""He’s a very difficult fighter. We need to go for him,"" he said. ""People talk, but I’m a mature fighter. I know how to control myself.  All I need to do is go into the ring, win and make history. “I want to unify the division. No one has done it in Latin America. In the world only a few fighters have done it — the best. I want to make history and be one of the best in the world.”"

Do you love or hate your flag? Welcome to a long-running artistic controversy
","
The Government's wish to bring back the Union Flag has reignited a culture war that has been raging in the art world for decades
",Nina Power,"
29 March 2021 • 1:04pm
","We live in a world of practically infinite symbols, logos, icons and avatars. And yet flags remain curiously resistant to becoming just another sign among many. A new edict from the Department of Culture, Media and Sport states that Government buildings should fly the   on a daily basis. Is that flag a little sop, in cloth form, to patriots? Or is it an airborne blind, behind which to hide an increasingly authoritarian Covid regime? Whatever the Government’s motives, we can take a step back from the political grind, and look to the symbolic: in the art world, the meaning of these strips of cloth has long been hotly contested. Last autumn, a group of artists in New Zealand called Mercy Pictures hosted a show, at a gallery of the same name, entitled People of Colour. The show consisted of hundreds of pictures of small painted flags (not the flags themselves) representing multiple countries, groups, organisations, identities, fictional places and projects. I was asked by the artists to write a short text about flags, which I was happy to do. I thought the show sounded interesting: what would be the effect of having representations of all these different flags alongside one another? Would their individual meaning be heightened or diminished? What might we learn about tribalism and belonging? What effect does removing symbols from their political context tell us about how art might tackle questions of belonging, nationhood and the symbolic realm as such? Somewhat predictably, in this era of manufactured outrage, the artists (and I, for that matter, despite having no role in the idea for the show) were accused of causing “great offense” because paintings of Nazi and white supremacist flags were included alongside paintings of Maori flags. The gallery was vandalised, and anyone who had anything to do with the show was pilloried, insulted and attacked, despite no one involved being any more a member of the far-Right than they were part of the UN Blue Helmets, or a resident of Narnia. As the writer James Robb neatly summarised it: “The provocative juxtaposition of the flags was the point of the show, raising questions about the symbolism and emotions human beings invest in flags, and the sensitivities, misunderstandings and offence caused when other people have different attitudes to a flag.” More recently, another flag show Down Under caused similar “upset”. Tasmania’s Dark Mofo festival pulled a piece titled Union Flag by the well-respected Spanish artist Santiago Sierra. The work, which consists of a Union Flag soaked in the freely-donated blood of people from colonised territories, is bluntly, but very obviously, addressing questions of history, violence, occupation and exploitation. But Santiago is Spanish, and therefore, according to the work’s detractors, somehow on the side of the coloniser, and thus the work must go. This logic is so racist it defies belief: no one who has ever been a member of a country that has ever committed violence – and let’s face it, there are virtually no states for which this is the case – can occupy a critical role in relation to their country’s past. How is history supposed to progress if all human beings are atavistic, and no one can ever do anything but represent their own tribe, however made-up that belong might be? What happened to our dreams of universalism and internationalism? Today’s identitarian logic allows no other kinds of collective being; you might think that we’re united in being human, but that’s Enlightenment reasoning, and therefore forbidden. We are almost all united as workers, but then we’re forcibly divided by race and sexual identity. It used to be understood that this kind of division best served those in power, but today consumerist and atomised distinctions rule. Even though First Nations donors gladly participated in Sierra’s project, their desire counts for nothing: art today, his detractors imply, can only be understood on the most literal level, and audiences must be protected from having to think too much. By that logic, fiction might as well be banned, and all cultural expression be strictly in accordance with the “identity” of the artist. If anyone is offended, anywhere, by anything, or pretends to be, everything is off! This is art as a mere extension of the worst kind of politics. But a brief glimpse backwards tells a more complex story of art and flags. Previously, it wasn’t literalists attempting to out-compete one another for the purest reason to cancel work, but rather conservatives reacting negatively to perceived desecration of the flag. Jasper Johns’s Flag (1955), for instance, like Mercy Pictures’ show, plays with the gap between a “real” and a “painted” flag; as with all the flag-based works Johns has made since, of which there are over a hundred, Flag remains enigmatic. More controversial was Dread Scott’s 1988 work, What is the Proper Way to Display a US Flag?, displayed in Chicago. Here, visitors had to decide whether to step on an American flag laid out on the floor, in order to answer the question posed by the title of the work in a ledger-book that sat on a shelf above it. President George HW Bush declared the work “disgraceful”, and the entire US Congress denounced it, voting in the Senate 97-0 to outlaw any placing of the Stars and Stripes on the ground anywhere at all. (Two years later, that law was ruled unconstitutional.) Scott’s work skilfully plays with context: does a flag belong in an art gallery at all? What distinguishes a flag from any other piece of material? What does desecration mean in a secular age? Has nationalism replaced religion? Flag-fear never seems to disappear. One way of removing their sting would be to see all flags as more or less equally empty: tribalism could be undermined in the name of a more light-hearted, humorous collective being that didn’t need any kind of flag at all. For a year or so, the UK has been drenched in rainbow flags, formerly (and still) the pennant of Gay Pride, its meaning expanded to represent the NHS and the “hope” that one day this pandemic will be over.  Many months later, it is revealing that the Government wants to bring back the Union Flag. This move is not really about patriotism, either for or against, though any distracting culture war can only be useful for those in authority. It is, in fact, more about creating a sense of fake unity against the enemy-virus. But Britain is genuinely divided, as a supposedly freedom-loving Government becomes increasingly authoritarian. People would like their lives back. As the issue of flags shows all too clearly, the censorship of art by the Left is often the mirror of tyranny from the Right."

Dinara Safina interview: 'I felt stupid saying I was world No 1 - I couldn't handle it'
","
Dinara Safina and Marat Safin are the only sister and brother to top the singles rankings, but their personalities couldn't be further apart
","Simon Briggs, ","
26 March 2021 • 8:00am
","Dinara Safina stood in front of her bathroom mirror, looked herself in the eye, and said, “I am No  1. I am the best.” It sounds like a scene from a mushy motivational movie – Dead Poets Society, perhaps, or A League of Their Own. But Safina experienced no surge of inspiration. No matter how she delivered the words, they just didn’t feel right. “Maybe for somebody it works,” she says during a Zoom call from her home in Monaco. “Maybe it helps self-motivation or self-confidence. But you have to be the kind of person who believes this. If you don’t believe, saying that makes no sense. You can repeat a thousand, million times. But you look at yourself and say, ‘I am stupid, saying this to myself.’ ” The scene dates from Safina’s defining season of 2009 – a bewildering, discombobulating, emotional switchback ride which would have sent anyone to the psychologist’s couch. That was the year she reached successive major finals in Melbourne and Paris, winning 53 of her first 64 matches. The trend pointed ever upwards, and yet the graph never spiked in a defining peak: the conquest of that elusive grand-slam trophy. In those two major finals, Safina collected a combined tally of nine games against Serena Williams and Svetlana Kuznetsova. She ran full tilt into a mental block. “Sometimes I couldn’t handle the pressure,” admitted Safina, who is still only 34. “That’s me personally. Still in the normal life I am very hard on myself. Everything has to be perfect – like this, like this, like this. “And sometimes, when the result was not what I expected, or what I would wish, I would get so disappointed.” Safina hails from a uniquely distinguished Russian tennis family. Her mother, Rauza Islanova, used to coach at the Spartak Moscow club with her babies suspended in a sling. Her father, Mikhail Safin, was the director of that club. And her brother, Marat, was the buccaneering, vodka-loving hellraiser who won the 2000 US Open as well as the 2005 Australian Open, which would prove to be the last slam for almost five years to escape the “Big Three” men. Marat and Dinara still stand unique as the only brother/sister duo to both reach No 1 in the world. Yet they are remembered very differently: him as the cool, sunglasses-wearing type known for inviting women to watch him from his player box, her as the nearly woman who never cemented her position at the top of the game. Did she ever ask him for advice on how to handle her anxieties? “It’s tough to speak with Marat, because I think male and female are very different,” Safina replied. “Whenever he has a stress situation for him it is a challenge – ‘What can I do out of this situation?’ For them [male players] it’s fun. For a female it is more like ‘Oh my God, if I play bad, I will be so embarrassed.’ You start to doubt in yourself.” If Safina never managed to overcome her big-match nerves, that is partly because her body did not give her the chance. A stress fracture in her lower back cut her career brutally short at the age of 25, and left her bracketed alongside Jelena Jankovic as a late-Noughties world No 1 who never won a major. (Caroline Wozniacki, the final member of this maligned trio, would eventually escape the “slam-less No 1” slur by winning the 2018 Australian Open.) What next for Safina, who officially retired in 2014? Having lacked expert guidance in her own career, she now wants to steer younger players away from the same pitfalls. Before the pandemic started, she had been planning a new coaching initiative in Valencia. “I would have loved to have had a mentor,” said Safina. “Psychologists say basic things, but they have never been in the situation – not even as visitors to the match. “For me, maybe it would have been more interesting to speak to some other tennis player. “After the [2009] French Open final, I had that scarring in my heart. I was maybe one week being depressed – ‘How can I lose this final?’– instead of thinking, ‘OK, what is next coming up, and what can I do better?’  ""I would love at that moment to have had a mentor who shakes me a little and says,  ‘Wait, it’s just the French Open final, you still have Wimbledon, you still have the US Open, so stop focusing on this.’”   True to her Moscovian roots, Safina is hard-headed about the disciplines that foster success. During our conversation, she spoke about her 5.30am starts at the Australian Open, fretted about the distracting influence of electronic gadgets and denounced Instagram as a “fake world where nobody knows what is true”. Some youngsters might retreat from her directness; others would surely thrive on it. Either way, she is well qualified to join Conchita Martinez and Amelie Mauresmo as elite performers now turned to coaching. “Conchita is doing great,” said Safina of Martinez, the former Wimbledon champion who has worked with Karolina Pliskova and Garbine Muguruza. “I just wonder why other players don’t ask, ‘Can I work with you?’ or, ‘Can I have you at least as part-time coach?’ “I think there are so many players would really love to share their experience and they can be really helpful. We know tennis from a different way, we have been there, we have played. “It would be more interesting to have more female coaches. When you are on the tour as a player, you have the team, the coach, the agent, who talk to you and you never lift up your head and say, ‘Wait – can I just look around?’ Instead open your eyes a little bit, step back. Say ‘The agent is not going to tell who is for me, I’m going to say who I want.’ Because you can always find the number of the person you want and talk to him or her. It’s not that we live on another planet.”  "

What Red Bull must do to topple Lewis Hamilton and Mercedes
","
For the first time in years, F1's greatest team in history look beatable — plus how a sandwich wrapper ended Fernando Alonso's return
",Luke Slater,"
29 March 2021 • 6:25pm
","If pre-season testing hinted that Mercedes' Lewis Hamilton-led dominance could be under serious threat, then   highlighted it, underlined it, and then  .  Red Bull and Max Verstappen will be gutted with their failure to capitalise on a winning position under lights in the desert. They should be. Regardless of their current form, they have not had many chances to win in the past few years and whatever their performance advantage in Bahrain, it was not enough. After just 14 wins in 119 races, contending for a championship is a new experience for a lot of this Red Bull team. They must now assess what they can do in the next eight months and 22 grands prix to topple F1’s most dominant team and driver. Here's how they can do it. As a driver, Verstappen is arguably Hamilton’s only equal on the grid. Provided that he and Hamilton are close in the points table, this gives the title fight a totally different dimension — and may help force mistakes from the champion. In the past two years Hamilton  , which was done with ease. In 2017 and 2018 he was  , who managed to put Hamilton under pressure, only to implode himself. There is very little that Mercedes and Hamilton have not achieved in their eight years of dominance. But defeating a driver of truly comparable talent and skills in comparable machinery? That is yet to happen.  But, in this record-breakingly long season, Red Bull cannot afford to give Mercedes and Hamilton a head start. They must repeat the intensity (but not the outcome) of their first race of the 2021 season. The seven and 13 points that Verstappen and Red Bull are behind respectively is neither here nor there, but if that morphs to 20 or 30 points in four or five rounds time – however close those races are – then Mercedes are back in their usual spot, which is where Hamilton feels comfortable.  For the past two years Red Bull have been fighting with one hand tied behind their back as first Pierre Gasly and then Alexander Albon failed to match Verstappen in qualifying and races. Can Sergio Pérez do any better? If Red Bull want to take their chances, he has to.  In fairness, he does not even have to match Verstappen, but he absolutely must be a factor at the front of the race and be close enough to him or both Hamilton and Bottas to stop Mercedes having two strategy options to cover the Dutchman. This was evident on Sunday: had Mercedes not botched Bottas’s second pit stop then Verstappen’s charge to the front would have been harder.  Pérez looked some way off Verstappen this weekend, but this is only his first race for the team. Red Bull should bear some responsibility for his lowly starting position after taking a risk on tyre choice in qualifying, but at worst he needs to be starting fourth and keeping both Mercedes honest.  Red Bull have been notoriously slow starters and have never truly challenged Mercedes dominance over a season. The last time Red Bull took pole position at the first race of the year was in 2013. The last time they had a car finish in the top two on its first outing? 2012. For the first time in the turbo-hybrid era, they are out of the blocks as contenders. It usually takes a while for them to walk the walk after talking the talk.  If the teams are as close as it seems then a development dilemma occurs for both of them. Do they plough resource into a tight championship fight or focus on the massive regulation changes for next year’s car? Fortunately, Red Bull’s development path is usually steep because it has had to be. Last year Mercedes stopped developing their 2021 car after seven rounds – this year they may be forced into a different approach.  Having the quickest car over one lap is a good start, but it is not enough. We know that from Ferrari's failed attempts in 2017 and 2018 and towards the end of 2019 (although the titles were all but decided). Hamilton has experienced this too, in his first year at Mercedes in 2013, when the team had a run of eight pole positions in nine races but only triumphed in three of them.  With these heavy, super high-downforce beasts, track position is important, as Hamilton proved. But a race is won on Sunday, not Saturday. It could become a sore point quickly if Verstappen continues to take pole positions yet is beaten by Hamilton on race day. Clearly, that cannot happen. It looks like Red Bull have the advantage in raw pace – perhaps even a hefty one in Verstappen’s hands – but there was little to separate them in the race on Sunday at any point. "

Manchester United teenager Lauren James the star of the show at the Theatre of Dreams
","
19 year-old stamps her mark on club's history books, scoring against West Ham on the Man Utd Women team's first-ever Old Trafford appearance
","Tom Garry, ","
27 March 2021 • 8:40pm
","Just as big stadiums might represent the future for women’s football, Lauren James could well represent the future success of the England national side and therefore it was fitting that it was the 19 year-old who scored Old Trafford’s first Women’s Super League goal. The young forward was the star of the show at the Theatre of Dreams and her header from a corner broke the deadlock to help Manchester United beat basement club West Ham United 2-0 and deepen the East Londoners’ relegation fears. A month ago, James - whose brother Reece plays for Chelsea and England - was the victim of abhorrent racist abuse on social media, but she has now stamped her mark on the club’s history books, scoring on the Manchester United Women team’s first-ever Old Trafford appearance. She was in the right place at the right time to flick home the opening goal shortly after half-time, and by the end of the game fans on social media were calling her ‘baby GOAT’, a nickname alluding to the idea that she might one day go on to be among the greatest of all time, if her progression continues. Don't bet against it. With her quick feet she was frequently gliding past her marker, and she is supremely strong, holding off defenders with ease using her upper-body strength. Most importantly, she has a keen eye for goal and routinely she is instinctively in exactly the right place in the attacking third, steps ahead of everyone else. She should have scored in the goalless first half and will have been frustrated to head over the bar from two yards, albeit under pressure from goalkeeper Courtney Brosnan's challenge. Clearly at ease on the big stage though, the teenager was Casey Stoney’s side’s bright spark, constantly busy in a tricky first half where West Ham’s five across the back proved difficult for Manchester United to break down, but their best moments came through James’ pace down the left, cutting inside from the flank. She fired a powerful strike straight at Brosnan in the first half, set up Christen Press for a golden opportunity that was spurned, and then cut inside and bent a near-perfect curler narrowly wide of the far post in the second, but by then the hosts were 2-0 up. West Ham will kick themselves for the manner of the opener, as Maria Thorisdottir was allowed to beat two West Ham defenders in the air at the far post to head the ball back to the near post where James had cleverly evaded her marker and was poised to nod in the crucial opener. Moments later, after the visitors gifted away possession in their own half, Holland midfielder Jackie Groenen’s perfectly-weighted through ball fed United States striker Press for the second. And the afternoon got worse for Olli Harder’s strugglers when his side’s Germany defender Laura Vetterlein was sent off for a second bookable offence with just under 15 minutes remaining. Harder’s team had their moments, going close through Martha Thomas and France’s Kenza Dali in the first half before Manchester United goalkeeper Mary Earps twice produced excellent saves to deny Iceland’s Dagny Brynjarsdottir, but the damage had been done by West Ham’s inability to keep focus defensively for the full 90 minutes. Before the game, Manchester United manager Casey Stoney had slammed a lack of television coverage, after the fixture was not initially selected by the BBC or BT Sport, with the switch to Old Trafford only made 11 days ago. Shortly before kick-off, though, it was announced that BT Sport 1 Extra (online) would be showing the game, and for those who did tune in, it was the jinking, twisting, direct-running James who provided the greatest entertainment. And on a historic day for Stoney’s team and indeed the wider Women’s Super League, it was one of the division’s youngest stars who showed why the future looks so bright for the English women’s game.

 Ramsey, Denton 
  Vetterlein (second yellow) Lisa Benn (Berkshire) Manchester City left it late against Reading but inspiration from England youngster Lauren Hemp gave them a dramatic victory to move top of the Women’s Super League. Gareth Taylor’s side had looked destined to endure a frustrating draw that would have left the title race out of their hands, but 20-year-old Hemp found a way through a stubborn Reading defence as she weaved past four players before squaring the ball for Chloe Kelly to hit the winner and kick off scenes of huge relief. It was City’s 11th consecutive league victory as, significantly, they bounced straight back after a tough week that had featured a comprehensive 3-0 defeat away against Catalan giants Barcelona in the first leg of their Women’s Champions League quarter-final on Wednesday. For long periods, it looked certain to be a day that badly damaged their hopes of pipping Chelsea to the WSL trophy, with Hemp hitting the post in the first half and Scotland midfielder Caroline Weir firing over the crossbar with 10 minutes to go. But, despite missing inspirational England captain Steph Houghton due to an Achilles injury, City eventually found a way through thanks to Hemp’s magical moment and they moved one point above Chelsea, who play their game in hand on Sunday. With four games left — including a home game against Chelsea in April — Taylor’s team now look poised to take the race all the way to the wire.

Why Povetkin vs Whyte is more than a fight: It's a £200 million audition

Victory in Gibraltar will propel Whyte towards fights with Fury, Joshua or even Wilder - all multi-million pound blockbuster contests

","The last time British heavyweight   left the ring, ‘The Bodysnatcher’ from Brixton had to haul himself up from the canvas after being knocked out clean by a highlight-reel left uppercut from Alexander Povetkin. On Saturday night, the 32-year-old enters the ring in Gibraltar for   aiming to reclaim the Interim WBC heavyweight title against his Russian rival and throw a £200million spanner in the works of  It’s the old game of ‘Snakes and Ladders’: win, and Whyte is back in the big time and the next cab off the rank should anything happen to Fury or Joshua. Lose, and he slides down the heavyweight ratings and will have to climb the ladder again, to be regarded as a gatekeeper for the up and comers. It is not where Whyte intends to reside and he has half an eye on muscling in on boxing’s biggest-ever fight, especially as the first of the two bouts does not yet have a date and venue. “Look, one of Fury or Joshua might get knocked out in the first fight, and say they’ve had enough,” Whyte explained to  “This is boxing, man. Let’s see what happens. The fight might even not happen. Boxing is a dog eat dog business, and you just have to win, get in position, and be ready. That’s my mindset.” Victory in Gibraltar will propel Whyte towards fights with Fury, Joshua or even Deontay Wilder - all multi-million pound blockbuster contests. But it is the £200m showdown that is on his mind. “It’s weird that it’s not signed. Why aren’t they both going on about the fight? It’s crazy,” Whyte continues. “If there’s one fight you need to be vocal about it’s this fight. If you’re not screaming and shouting about this fight you must be dead, you must have a dead soul. “Let me fight for the title and I’ll sign a contract saying I’ll fight these guys next back-to-back. I’ll be the assassin. I’m on straight smoke. I would assassinate all these guys for them, free of charge.” But if they do fight, Whyte adds, “it’s hard to pick. Fury has been inactive for a long time, and Joshua has grasped a safer way of boxing. For me, it's a 50/50 fight.” Whyte, for so long the nearly man in the heavyweight division, had dominated the Russian for four rounds and had knocked him down twice in their first contest last August. Then a moment for which the heavyweight division is famous: the knockouts. Size and weight equals power, and in heavyweight boxing, when 17 and 18st men collide, it is so often lights out. “I’ll always be a junkyard dog because that’s where I come from. Boxing is a dog eat dog world, it’s a tough world,” Whyte says. “This is the most important fight of my career. Like I said this is boxing, I’ve been through ups and downs my whole life so I’m used to bouncing back, proving people wrong, showing people what I can do when they’ve written me off.” “Let’s see if he can make changes and how many changes he makes at this stage in his career,” Whyte explains. “We’ll see. I’ve never seen him celebrate a victory like that. He’s usually a cool, calm, collected guy. He couldn’t believe he won. “I’m not a guy that visualises the knockout or that kind of stuff but I know I’ll stop him. Visualising and reality are two different things. I make things a reality. Povetkin’s a good fighter, a top amateur, Olympic gold medallist, but I’m learning, improving and getting better every day. “On Saturday I’m going to leave it all on the line once again. The main thing is the win. My coaching team has worked hard on different plans and working different areas.” Povetkin strikes a different tone. “I’ve almost forgotten about the last fight because this is finished,” he says. “I think that Dillian will be better in the second fight than the first. At the same time, I’ll try to be more careful, pay attention more to my defence. I don’t have this mindset that I’ll knock him out. It could go the distance; I’m not focusing on the knockout and I’m going to follow my plan.” Both men are likely to be cagey and cautious in the opening forays second time around. Whyte will have to avoid the Russian's traps, but the improved jab of the Londoner should see him command the bout with his left hook detonating later in the contest - rounds 7 to 11 - when Whyte lands his famed left hook. But with heavyweight boxing anything can happen.  Whyte by TKO or KO, rounds 7 to 11."

Bicycle bombers: Two-wheeled Suffragettes and thwarting Adolf Hitler in the Second World War
","
In an extract from her new book, Hannah Ross explores the radical role of bicycles in the fight for women's freedom
",Hannah Ross,"
30 March 2021 • 7:30am
","In April 1914, a few months before the outbreak of war, two young women arrived at a seaside boarding house to begin a cycling tour of Suffolk. Their fortnight sojourn coincided with a string of arson attacks. Great Yarmouth’s Britannia Pier was set alight, flames destroying everything but the iron girders, while the grand finale was the torching of the Bath Hotel in Felixstowe. The attacks bore all the hallmarks of the Women’s Social and Political Union (WSPU) — also known as the Suffragettes - including notes left in the wreckage proclaiming, ‘There can be no peace until women get the vote’. The two ‘lady cyclists’ were WSPU members Hilda Burkitt and Florence Tunks, who were swiftly arrested and sentenced to two years and nine months, respectively. The bicycle — as a form of resistance — was embedded in the DNA of the Suffragette movement from the very start, led by the Pankhursts. As teenagers, Christabel and Sylvia Pankhurst joined a local Manchester cycling club, the Clarion CC — an offshoot of the socialist newspaper. Swapping industrial Manchester for rides on country lanes ‘they were part of a growing trend of women’s cycling, though in 1897 the Clarion was one of very few UK clubs to admit women members’. When Sylvia’s father, Richard, died in 1898, Manchester CC members joined the funeral procession on their bikes. In 1903 the Pankhursts founded the WSPU, and moved to London where Christabel and Sylvia wrote about the suffragette cause for the Clarion. Bicycles became an efficient campaign tool for the organisation, with members cycling through towns and villages to spread the word about votes for women.  From 1909 the Elswick Cycle Manufacturing Company began selling bicycles in the suffragette colours, sporting a badge designed by Sylvia with the union’s motif: the ‘angel of freedom’. The suffragettes’ steed had a drop-frame to accommodate long skirts and featured elegant curved handlebars. When campaigning turned militant, bicycles became getaway vehicles. Edith Rigby, the first woman to ride a bicycle in her hometown of Preston in the 1890s, was pelted with eggs and rotten vegetables for her brazen act. Years later, as a suffragette, she planted a bomb in the basement of the Liverpool Cotton Exchange and set fire to Lord Leverhulme’s country residence. She escaped to Ireland on a bicycle disguised as a man. In the ‘pillar-box outrages’ of 1913, suffragettes poured flammable liquids into Royal Mail post boxes, before pedaling away from the blaze. In 1914 Olive Beamish and Elsie Duval fled on their bicycles under cover of darkness having set fire to the Surrey mansion, Trevethan. The house was empty ensuring no one would get hurt — a prerequisite for all suffragette arson attacks. With the start of the First World War, the WSPU suspended all militant activities to focus on the war effort. The 1918 Representation of the People Act granted some women over the age of thirty the right to vote, and universal suffrage followed a decade later. But the bicycle’s role in women resisting oppression did not end there. During the Second World War it became a useful tool for freedom fighters — ironically as Hitler wasn’t a fan. Having loathed being a bicycle messenger in the First World War, as Chancellor he introduced a raft of anti-cycling laws, issuing a ban on Jewish people owning bicycles, and confiscating bikes in Nazi occupied territories such as the Netherlands. The young Audrey Hepburn used her bicycle to deliver resistance leaflets in her Dutch hometown of Arnhem, while the British record-breaking cyclist Evelyn Hamilton claimed she couriered messages for the resistance in Paris during the occupation. When the Allies liberated the Netherlands in 1945, many German soldiers stole bicycles to escape back to Germany. For decades afterward the Dutch chanted, ‘Give us back our bicycles’ when their team played Germany at football. In Nazi-occupied Paris, the writer and philosopher Simone de Beauvoir learned to ride on a stolen bicycle. She delighted in the sensations of weightlessness, physical freedom and independence as she spun through the city streets, ‘I only wanted to eat up the kilometres on my bicycle. It’s a new joy in life I’ve discovered’. In August 1941 she took a cycling trip with Jean-Paul Sartre to the so-called ‘Free Zone’ of the South of France under the collaborationist Vichy government, crossing the border under cover of darkness — the first of several such cycle touring adventures for the two writers. De Beauvoir was critical of Sartre’s erratic approach to cycling, accusing him of ‘pedalling so indolently’ that he would career into roadside ditches. He would claim he was too busy thinking. Both shared a love of whizzing downhill at speed, but on their return journey over the steep climbs of the Maritime Alps, de Beauvoir had an accident. After stopping for lunch and a few glasses of wine, they had begun an exhilarating freewheel towards Grenoble. But, in an attempt to avoid oncoming cyclists, she found herself skidding and heading towards the precipice. Concussed, she was forced to swap her bicycle for the train the rest of the way. ‘I had lost a tooth,’ recalled de Beauvoir, ‘one of my eyes was closed, my face had swollen up to twice its normal size, and the skin was all scraped raw. I couldn’t get so much as a grape between my lips.’ The missing tooth made a ‘miraculous’ reappearance a few weeks later when it emerged from a boil she squeezed on her chin back in Paris. A few months after VE day, de Beauvoir set off on a new bicycle given to her by Sartre ‘on a little journey all alone’. The horrors of war were ebbing away, and women in France were finally given the right to vote — over twenty-five years after the UK and US. We don’t know if de Beauvoir did much cycling after that, as her literary stardom took her to the US. But it’s clear that during some very dark times, when freedom felt like a distant memory, it was a way for her to experience a sense of release and liberation. As her legs turned the pedals it may also have helped spark ideas which contributed to her writings on feminism and existentialism, which made her one of the greatest thinkers of the twentieth century."

Maro Itoje: Eddie Jones is a 'truly special' England coach - he must stay
","
When a player like Itoje says Jones should be retained 'without shadow of a doubt' after Six Nations failure, that is an unequivocal message
","Daniel Schofield, ","
29 March 2021 • 12:24pm
","With Eddie Jones’  , Maro Itoje would happily volunteer himself as a first witness for the defence in the trial of the England head coach. This by itself is significant. As a player, Itoje is likely to remain the totem of this England team for years to come. He is already England’s most marketable player and his profile is starting to transcend beyond rugby, which only a select handful of players have previously managed. So when the 26 year-old says that Jones should be retained “without a shadow of a doubt” after England’s fifth-place Six Nations finish, that is an unequivocal message that will be heard by the RFU’s powerbrokers. No amount of gloss can make the campaign seem better than it actually was but Itoje’s message amounts to Keep Calm and Carry On. Jones pulled England out of a tailspin once in 2018; he can do it again. In the immediate aftermath of  , Itoje described Jones as a “truly special” coach and that is a theme he is happy to pick up again.  “I think Eddie’s work rate is second to none,” Itoje tells  . “The man does not sleep, he really does not sleep. He works very hard. He has an incredible sense and feel for people. He knows how to motivate people. He knows how to command a room. He is probably about 5ft 6in but he can walk into a room and command authority and respect.” When Itoje first came on the scene, Jones described him as a Vauxhall Viva who needed to become a BMW. The second row embraced that challenge, although his engine stalled a couple of times during a Six Nations in which  , five of which came  . In that instance, there was no need for a lengthy post-mortem with Jones. “I think after that game, you pretty much know if you are honest with yourself,” Itoje said. “I knew straight away I needed to do better. I did have a conversation with Eddie after that game but he and I both knew what needed to be done.” Jones’ carrot-and-stick approach remains. It is understood that he has previously used the stats of All Blacks lock Brodie Retallick to force improvement from Itoje. But in getting the best out of individuals, Jones looks beyond just the player to tap into their potential. Itoje reveals Jones was instrumental in persuading him to take up a Masters degree in business administration.  “Eddie has had a huge impact on my career, no doubt,” Itoje said. “He never allows me to just be happy with what I have achieved, not that I would anyway, or what the team has achieved. He is constantly looking to squeeze more and more out of you. “He challenges me to have more influence on the team, but also to be an all-round better person. I am studying for a Masters at the moment and I remember about two years ago I mentioned to him I was thinking about it. He was pushing me to do it more, so probably after my dad he was the second pushiest person wanting me to do that.” The question frequently raised about Jones is quite how far he pushes his players. His intense training methods have broken bodies while the mental toll may be even higher, particularly during the Covid-19 restrictions. However, Itoje insists there is no alternative at this level. “In high-performance sport, you have to be pushed hard,” Itoje said. “There is a balance to it. As players we want to be pushed. As players we want to make sure that we get the very best out of ourselves.  “Another thing about Eddie, no-one is more critical than him of what needs to be done. He is constantly looking for ways to get better and for the team to get better and for the players to get better. He has been coaching a long time and his passion to continue to get better and continue to learn is remarkable.” There is no mistaking Itoje’s relief to be out of the bubble after nearly nine weeks cooped up at the Lensbury Club in Teddington. “It is liberating to walk outside your room without putting a face mask on,” Itoje said. “It takes time to slowly decompress and try to relax. Fortunately, Saracens have given me this week to do just that. I am in a decent place at the moment.” With his time off, Itoje has teamed up with Under Armour to announce a £1 million donation of sports equipment to disadvantaged communities within the United Kingdom and Africa through the charity,  . “It is giving those communities who don’t have access to sports equipment a leg up so they can get that one step closer to expressing themselves through the sport they love,” Itoje said.  Earlier this year, Itoje threw his weight behind a campaign to help tackle laptop shortages in schools which leaves a significant number of young people unfairly disadvantaged. As Oliver Brown recently wrote in  ,  . He wants to leave his mark on society as well as sport.  “When I look at athletes who I admire the most, they are obviously great at what they do, they are Championship-level athletes,” Itoje said. “But the ones I admire the most are the ones who have some kind of impact, or who are different and who can have a long-lasting impact on people’s lives. The very top tier of athletes do that and if I can have a fraction of that positive impact on other people’s lives then that will be a job well done.”"

Birmingham battle back from 'diabolical' first half to draw with Bristol City in relegation battle
","
The sides share the spoils and both move further away from the WSL's single relegation spot
","Tom Garry, ","
28 March 2021 • 8:13pm
","Birmingham City manager Carla Ward slammed her side’s ""diabolical"" first-half display but praised their response to a half-time telling off, after coming back to earn a point at home to Bristol City in a key game in the relegation battle. Bristol City forward Charlie Wellings gave the visitors a deserved first-half lead with a scrappy goal against her former club, after Carla Humphrey’s effort was not cleared, and a furious Ward’s displeasure was evident. ""The first half was probably our worst half of the season,"" Ward said. ""We were absolutely terrible, diabolical. We were sloppy, we didn’t look after the ball. ""We didn’t have any work rate, desire or attitude, there wasn’t a single minute of the first half that I was remotely pleased with. We didn’t look interested and that isn’t acceptable. We had an honest conversation at half-time and the reaction was very good."" The draw was a fair outcome from a feisty contest, after Birmingham captain Christie Murray hit a swerving strike with the outside of her boot into the top corner to equalise. Both teams could have won it, with Ebony Salmon firing narrowly wide for the visitors at 1-0, while Sarah Mayling had a superb strike touched on to the crossbar at the other end, but the draw edged both teams further away from the single relegation spot. ""It’s not a disaster that we haven’t won. It was vitally important we didn’t lose today,"" said interim Bristol City manager Matt Beard, whose team were bottom of the WSL when he arrived in January to provide maternity cover for Tanya Oxtoby and now sit 10th, above Aston Villa and West Ham, who both have two games in hand. ""I think one more win will be enough [for safety]. Now we have 11. We’ve worked incredibly hard to get where we are."" Ward believes her ninth-placed team would have probably guaranteed safety if they had won, but added: ""I’d like to think we’re nearly there. It’s a really interesting run-in. Mentality it’s not a problem for this group, they’re a tough-minded group and they’ll dig in."" Just four points separate the bottom four teams and 11th-placed Aston Villa have games to come against everybody involved, including two meetings with bottom side West Ham.  "

Jofra Archer cut hand dropping fish tank in the bath
","
The fast bowler was attempting to clean the tank at home in January
","Nick Hoult, ","
29 March 2021 • 2:00pm
","Jofra Archer suffered a cut to his hand after dropping his fish tank in the bath adding his name to future quiz questions about bizarre injuries suffered by sport stars down the years. when he has surgery on Tuesday to determine whether there is any infection in the wound. Archer is understood to have cut his hand while attempting to clean his fish tank at home in January, before flying to India, although the minor injury had healed up by the time he joined up with the Test squad. It only came to light at the weekend when England announced he would be having a ‘procedure’ on the injury today. “Jofra cut his hand before he came here but when he arrived the wound had closed up. It didn't really give him too much hassle to be honest,” said Chris Silverwood, the England head coach. “The fact is when he's at home getting his elbow injected it gave us an opportunity to assess his finger as well and see if there's any more sort of infection there or anything. I'm not quite sure what's in there. Obviously he'll see the specialist and they'll make an assessment but it was just an ideal time for him to get it looked at while he was waiting for the injection to work on his elbow.” Archer has already had a cortisone injection in his right elbow. He has been beset by injuries over the past year with his elbow first flaring up in South Africa in early 2020 and he has not looked fully fit since. Surgery is likely to be the only alternative if this latest cortisone injection does not work. The finger injury is thought to be minor and not likely to be causing him any long lasting problems whereas the elbow is a major worry. England are very reluctant to operate on a fast bowler’s bowling arm for fear of any lasting damage from the surgery but rest and injections have not worked so far.r Archer played in all five T20s against India despite missing two Tests with elbow pain. He did fade as the T20 series wore on and while Rajasthan Royals remain hopeful he will play a part in the IPL, England should not risk a relapse playing in a league a long way from the supervision of their own medical staff. "

Five years of Eddie Jones: His 47 England debutants, where they are now - and why there has not been one fly-half  
","
The legacy of Stuart Lancaster is obvious in the main-stays of England's squad over the past five years
","Charlie Morgan, ","
2 March 2021 • 9:45am
","Five years and 62 Tests into the tenure of head coach Eddie Jones, it is fair to say that England have reached a sticky patch.  to go with  . As far as Test victories, Jones remains two shy of his England half-century. He has spoken about the need to continually develop his side by integrating new faces, and you sense significant change must be around the corner – even if England finish this Six Nations with wins against France and Ireland to take their boss to 50. Jones has used a total of 82 players in Test matches, 47 of whom were given their senior international debuts by the Australian. Those players are highlighted by the yellow bars on this chart, which displays England caps won since the start of 2016. It may jog a few memories, and certainly paints a picture of Jones’ most trusted individuals: This next table shows just the 47 Jones debutants, subjectively colour-coded by their current standing in the squad. Blue represents those that have established themselves in the first-choice match-day 23. Green delineates fringe players or those still very early in their Test careers. Purple suggests they do not seem in danger of collecting another England cap unless there is a change in head coach, a catastrophic injury crisis, a drastic rethink from Jones or more fixtures that run alongside a British and Irish Lions tour: Before we look at each of these categories in detail, as well as players who are yet to be capped, here are some headlines: The fly-half situation is a glaring oddity. If we include Nick Isiekwe as a lock, Brad Shields as a back-rower, Jack Singleton as a hooker and Joe Marchant as a centre, the full positional breakdown of Jones’ debutants is as follows: seven back three players, six centres, four scrum-halves, 16 tight-five forwards and 14 back-rowers. No fly-halves. England’s starts at fly-half since 2016 have been shared between three players. George Ford has made 45 of them, Owen Farrell 16 and Danny Cipriani one. Every other side in the Six Nations and Rugby Championship have handed their number 10 shirt to more men in the same period. Even Ireland, derided for their reliance on Johnny Sexton, have given Test starts to Billy Burns, Jack Carty, Joey Carbery, Paddy Jackson and Ross Byrne: Jones has made no secret of the fact that he inherited a strong group from predecessor Stuart Lancaster, something we will explore later. The subsequent influence of Ford and Farrell, who were 22 and 24 when Jones took over, is emblematic of that. Their age-profile, quality and character were always likely to bring caps by the bucket load. But Jones’ dependence on them, as well as the stasis at scrum-half, has been stark. Contingency plans have been rarely clear to those outside the inner sanctum. Marcus Smith was the original apprentice,  .  . The young Wasps pair of Jacob Umaga, apparently third choice given his involvement in the 2020 Six Nations camp, and Charlie Atkinson are currently part of the ‘shadow squad’. All remain uncapped. Max Malins is probably a realistic back-up option at the moment. In the past, full-back George Furbank and centre Piers Francis have been mentioned – not particularly convincingly – as potential stand-ins. Long- or medium-term injuries to both Ford and Farrell would leave Jones exposed. How has he done when it comes to debutants in other positions, though? Lancaster’s legacy is clear at the top of this section.  , who became the first of Jones’ debutants to reach 50 caps last weekend, and   (46 caps under Jones) were involved in England’s preparations for Rugby World Cup 2015. Lancaster even mooted Daly’s switch to full-back in conversation with then-Wasps honcho Dai Young.  (42) toured New Zealand with England as far back as 2014, coming off the bench against the Crusaders. Elsewhere, though, Jones deserves credit for pushing through   (31),  (26) and  . Both of the ‘Kamikaze Kids’, Curry and Underhill,   and would have racked up even more Test appearances without frustrating injuries. Jones also rewarded   (21) for prolonged domestic excellence with Newcastle Falcons.  appears to have ousted Harry Williams as Sinckler’s deputy.  (11) and   (10) are included in this category despite not having started a Test. Earl’s versatility and dynamism add value. Robson is the latest of Ben Youngs’ understudies. Of the top 23 players when it comes to England caps since 2016, just four – Daly, Itoje, Sinckler and now Curry – are Jones’ debutants. Again, that reflects the strong core Lancaster left behind. and  (both 19 caps under Jones) are the most experienced here. The latter blew hot and cold in his Cardiff cameo, conceding a poor penalty but  . He has stiff competition from other locks, but has featured in the back row. Jones’ penchant for six-two splits of forwards among his replacements boosts Ewels’ prospects. is hanging in this section by virtue of training with England during their Autumn Nations Cup campaign. It is easy to forget that the explosive, offloading 23-year-old was nominated for the 2019 World Rugby breakthrough player of the year award alongside South Africa scrum-half Herschel Jantjies and France fly-half Romain Ntamack, the eventual winner. (1), introduced in the autumn of 2018 against Japan, is still 21. Captain of Worcester, he also trained with England last year.  (1) joined the fray at the Stadio Olimpico last October. (6),  (4),   (3),   (2) are all shadow squad members, with   (8) promoted there upon the withdrawal of   (3).  , Willis appeared in a strong position to shake up the back-row pecking order.  (7),   (6),  (4) and  are closer to the action, vying for front-line places this Six Nations and hoping to kick on. Malins and Lawrence are exciting talents. Given opportunities, they could offer something different to the backline. What an eclectic list this is. Code-hopper  (5) had  .   (2), another wing, was a World Cup wildcard. . He has garnered the same amount of Test appearances as Manu Tuilagi since 2016.   (9),  and  , part of Jones’ very first match-day 23 at Murrayfield five years ago, all made fleeting appearances in the murky area that is England’s midfield.  (13) served his purpose at scrum-half, even being named as a vice-captain, and was a hamstring ping away from facing the Springboks in the 2019 World Cup final.   (4) did get a runners-up medal, but has evidently not persuaded Jones that he is the solution at scrum-half.   (1) came off the bench for a blockbuster finale against the Pumas in San Juan. (8) answered the great loosehead prop injury crisis of 2018, and impressed.   (5) and  (2) were tried out at tighthead.   (3), emergency flanker cover at the World Cup, and  (1) appeared at hooker very briefly.  (3) had been excelling in the six jersey for Saracens. Jones deployed him as a lock, and did not relish the results. And then there is the catalogue of back-rowers. Number eight   (22 caps under Jones) tops it. His last Test outing was the Calcutta Cup shootout in 2019.  .   (8) fell just short of the plane to Japan and then out of favour.   (5) was infamously hooked in Sydney.  (2) had a go, as did one-time apprentice  (2) The latter, in fine form for Bath,  . He will doubtlessly improve there. Finally, to  (7). Nobody embodies Jones’ apparent scepticism of the club scene quite like Exeter Chiefs’ dynamo. Prolific try-scoring and electric pace are not his only assets. Only last Friday, he amassed 18 tackles and forced a number of turnovers in a dogged defensive performance against Sale Sharks. And yet, Jones seems to have seen enough over the 26-year-old’s seven caps between 2017 and 2018. Jerome Kaino, the double world champion All Black, heralded the ability of Simmonds recently, via a now-deleted tweet, after facing him with Toulouse. The complete index of players to have trained with England under Jones without winning a cap is dizzying. Only this week, it was announced that Leicester Tigers wing Jordan Olowofela would be heading from the East Midlands to Western Force on loan. He was called up in August 2018,  . Ibitoye is now in France, having traded Agen for Montpellier following his departure from Harlequins. There have been South African-born tighthead props, Nick Schonert and Simon Kerrod. Cameron Redpath’s knee injury on the verge of the 2018 tour to South Africa  . Alex Dombrandt has been monitored, so too Northampton Saints youngsters Alex Moon, Fraser Dingwall, Harry Mallinder and Alex Mitchell. Ben Curry also belongs in this camp for now and . George Martin came close to becoming the 48th Jones debutant on Saturday. The former England Under-18 captain had been part of   with players such as Redpath, Lawrence, Earl and Ted Hill. It was not as left-field a pick as some would believe. Harry Randall’s ankle injury was unfortunate, because his ruck-to-ruck speed and zippy passing could – theoretically – carry him past Robson and Youngs into a starting role at scrum-half. Paolo Odogwu is still in the holster as well. Reports suggested that tearaway hooker Alfie Barbeary, who trained with England before the Autumn Nations Cup final, was set for the Six Nations squad before he damaged ankle ligaments playing for Wasps. As the immediate impact of Tom Curry and Sam Underhill demonstrated for England in 2019, it only takes tweaks to completely revitalize a side. The challenge of straddling two World Cup cycles and maintaining momentum, though, is very difficult. Jones’ next steps in selection could be his most influential to date."

Inside Line: How Scotland flanker Hamish Watson stood out in his big Lions audition
","
The Scotland flanker finished with the second-highest number of carries in the Six Nations this year
","Ben Coles, ","
29 March 2021 • 11:32am
","Is there a more tricky area for Warren Gatland and his selection for the British and Irish Lions this summer than the back row? With a bounty of contenders to pick from everyone has a favourite, but you had  , hurtling around the field with abandon right until the death for Scotland to secure their first win in Paris since 1999.  As my colleague Charlie Morgan pointed out on Twitter over the weekend, Watson finished the tournament having made 67 carries (2nd of all players), 14 broken tackles (=5th), 4 turnovers won (=4th), 55 tackles made (15th). Even more impressively, given he's a flanker living his best life at the heart of each breakdown, Watson didn't concede a single penalty, nor did he miss a tackle in defence. Here are some of his best bits against France. You can find examples of Watson's speed across the different areas of the game, and this burst from the one of the restarts stuck out. Watson's set to pair up with Sam Johnson for a pod just behind the 10-metre line in case France go short with the kick-off. Noticing the kick is heading long, Watson turns... And comfortably gets to the back pod in time to get Skinner up in the air, with France applying pressure. Skinner slaps the ball back for Scotland to win possession before Ali Price clears out of Scotland's half. Next, two examples of Watson's pace both off the line and as a covering defender. France are pinned back in their own 22 and Antoine Dupont wants his pack to create a bit of room before carrying out a clearance kick. Watson, primed with Skinner, is in place to shut down Julian Marchand's carry... And despite Marchand having two French players supporting him as he carries into contact, Watson's speed off the line with Skinner in support shuts the carry down, forcing Dupont to put in an average box kick clearance into touch and allowing Scotland to keep the pressure on. The next moment however might have been Watson's biggest contribution of the match. After Scotland are turned over just short of half-time, France look to attack quickly in transition. Watson nearly gets to Charles Ollivon in time to stop the French captain's pass but is a fraction late, meaning Ollivon gets the ball away and France are off. France move the ball to Alldritt who makes a line break. You can see Watson spotting the situation and preparing to set off... Impressively, given his starting position and with Alldritt is racing into space, Watson quickly makes up the ground to shut Alldritt down. Finally, Watson's ability to beat defenders one-on-one can't be underestimated. Taking an offload from Nick Haining and facing a tackle from Virimi Vakatawa, Watson impressively ties Vakatawa up with his footwork before racing around the France outside centre, before Vakatawa recovers to make a double tackle with Arthur Vincent. Now, Watson's only 5ft 11, and that will be enough for most people to instantly take him out of the equation for the tour to South Africa. But as you saw with the carry above, there's enough speed and footwork there for Watson to get out of contact or to push bigger defenders backwards. The type of carry below - and Watson made 67 of them don't forget in this Six Nations - typified his approach, soaking up the contact of Vakatawa and then powering through the challenge with Dupont coming in to haul him down. Two of Watson's other carries that stuck out came when he was required to mop up loose ball, and there was plenty of that on Friday with the miserable weather in Paris. After Ntamack spills a high ball from a Scottish's clearance, Watson picks up and turns, before riding the tackle of Arthur Vincent and making good ground, turning a tricky situation into a net gain. There was a similar moment late in the second half, the slippery ball pinging around off everyone after being slapped back by Scotland from a restart. Watson picks up and has France's prop Uini Atonio looming over him running into a tackle. Cleverly, he uses Atonio's momentum against him, with Watson spinning out of the tackle and again making extra ground. That ability to gain forward progress out of situations where it looks as though Watson is about to get shut down is impressive. Watson's prowess at the breakdown showed up a couple of times in Paris, although the two turnovers he did win unfortunately came when France had an advantage for penalties. First up, Damian Penaud has been forced to cut in after Scotland's drift defence works well, although Penaud has beaten two tacklers and looks a threat. In comes Watson, making a tackle and getting straight over the ball to win a turnover, flicking the ball back in the process. The next effort is arguably more impressive, because he has to reach over his back row colleague Jamie Ritchie to turn possession over. Watson is ready for the carry of Cyril Baille... And with the tackle made by his team-mates, readjusts his shape to impressive stay on his feet and scoop the ball away from Baille on the deck, coming up with possession. The work put in by Watson as well during the final passage of play between the 82nd and 84th minutes deserves credit, with Scotland searching for a winning try. As Scotland moved the ball from left to right in search of a breakthrough, Watson finished that passage having made two carries while also hitting seven rucks in the space of two minutes. That's all the more impressive when you consider the work Watson had put in up until that point, finishing the game as Scotland's top carrier with 17 and their third-highest tackler with 13. For balance, there was one moment where Watson's hesitation cost Scotland. Following Johnson's excellent run, stopped short of the posts, Watson is there in time to kick off the next phase of attack. But he hesitates ever so slightly waiting for Skinner (coming into shot on the right) to make the pass, and France pounce. Camille Chat captialises by rushing up and Watson is driven 10 metres back, with Scotland losing significant ground. It's a moment Watson would no doubt love to play again, perhaps by carrying into contact himself. Who knows if Watson has done enough to convince Gatland that he deserves a spot in his squad, but, the fact that he's Scotland's only representative on the shortlist of the 2021 Player of the Championship award sums up how good his form has been in recent weeks. Touring with the Lions would be just reward for an excellent, dynamic back-row at the end of another strong Six Nations."

Why women's sport cannot ignore the 'alarm bell' of missing periods

Bobby Clay was tipped to be athletics’ next big star - but was diagnosed with osteoporosis at 18 after years of overtraining and undereating
",Fiona Tomas,"
26 February 2021 • 7:00am
","Bobby Clay remembers the tear that slid down her mother’s face in the surgery, trying to process the doctor’s earth-shattering words. She was 20. “He turned to my mum and said ‘Your daughter will never have children’. She didn’t say a word. That’s when I decided to change,” Clay tells  . A successful middle-distance runner who had won countless vests for Great Britain, Clay was tipped to be athletics’ next big star. She was fourth in the 1500m at the 2013 World Youth Championships, crowned European junior champion two years later and made the Great Britain under-20s team when she was just 15. Three years later, she was diagnosed with osteoporosis, a result of years of overtraining and undereating. That merciless combination meant her body had been deprived of oestrogen, the female sex hormone which is crucial for bone density.   Clay first realised something was wrong after fracturing her foot in a swimming pool doing a tumble turn. On another occasion, her shin snapped when she sat down in the gym. Both were clues that she was suffering from Relative Energy Deficiency in Sport (RED-s) Syndrome – formerly known as ‘the female athlete triad’ – which can cause devastating effects due to low energy availability. In 2019,   became the first high-profile female athlete to speak out about her experience with RED-s. The condition isn’t found exclusively in women – Britain’s Olympic gold cyclist Chris Boardman retired in his early 30s due to weak bones and low testosterone. In women, the condition manifests itself in an early warning sign – the absence of periods – which Clay maintains are still glorified in athletics. “I would have been mortified if I had had a period during my teenage years,” she said. “I would have instantly thought ‘I’m out of shape, I’m not race fit.’ I thought it meant that my body fat would be over a certain percentage. That mentality was the norm.” Clay was put on hormone replacement therapy – usually used for older women to relieve the symptoms of the menopause – to kick-start her body, wake up its reproductive system and artificially induce her first period. “I started taking it and within a week, I blew up,” recalls Clay. “My whole face was so much chubbier. It happened so quickly that I didn’t recognise myself. That’s when I really started to struggle with body image.”   Clay had never struggled with her physique as an athlete, despite being known as the “chunky one” among her peers and “surrounded” by eating disorders in the sport. She vehemently insists she never had a dysfunctional relationship with food as an athlete, so when she learned that her osteoporosis was linked with RED-s – commonly seen in athletes who are obsessively restrictive about their food intake – it was a shock. RED-s is not exclusive to elite endurance athletes, although they are generally at a higher risk due to their increased energy expenditure. A study published last year in the British Medical Journal found that of 112 elite female Australian athletes from eight sports, 80 per cent demonstrated at least one symptom of RED-s. “You can go through every bodily system and find a reason why under-fuelling is a bad idea for performance,” explains Dr Anita Biswas,senior sports physician at the English Institute of Sport   and co-lead of SmartHER, an EIS initiative promoting awareness of female athlete health. “There is good evidence that your decision-making could be affected, that your adaptation to strength training can be reduced and it can impact your mood and concentration.” Dr Biswas commonly sees RED-s in athletes transitioning from junior to senior programmes who, like Clay, simply underestimate the amount of energy they need. However, the normalisation around missing periods is also a major contributing factor. “It’s common for elite athletes to have irregular cycles, even if they’re fuelling adequately and their body composition is good,” adds Dr Biswas. “But missed periods or no periods shouldn’t be considered normal. It’s a really concerning myth.” The oral contraceptive pill – which studies have shown is the most frequent type of hormonal contraception used by sportswomen – can also mask hormonal problems associated with RED-s. This is because the pill artificially induces a monthly bleed – not a period – at an athlete’s convenience. “An athlete might think that because they’re having a withdrawal bleed, everything is fine,” adds Dr Biswas. “But when you’ve got a female athlete on the pill, you’re effectively putting them into the category where men are, where it’s much harder to realise that there’s a problem.” After being pressured into changing her body composition by a coach, Cain lost so much weight while training at the now-disgraced Nike Oregon Project that she lost her periods for three years and broke five bones due to osteoporosis. Clay went public with her own battle with the condition after penning a harrowing testimony in   in 2017, after which she received hundreds of messages from former athletes who had suffered in the same way. “It makes me upset thinking about the number of people who had this happen to them. They’ve had to work out what their life is without running. They didn’t just drop the sport – that’s such a blase way to look at someone who’s gone through hell and back.” As part of her recovery, she came across Train Brave, a campaign founded by Renee McGregor, one of the country’s leading sports dietitians who specialises in eating disorders. The project aims to raise awareness about RED-s and to change the fitness culture of overtraining and under-fuelling. “I get so many emails from runners who think they need to lose another 5kg to reach their sub-three hour marathon PB,” says McGregor, who has noticed an increase in the number of recreational exercisers in her clinic who have developed dysfunctional relationships with food during the pandemic. “The number on the scale is never going to determine how fast you run. It’s such an ingrained stigma in endurance sports and definitely one of the biggest fallacies out there.” Now 23, Clay is already living with the long-term consequences of osteoporosis, which she has been told is irreversible. With running now being too high impact for her body, she took up track cycling at Loughborough University, but ended up fracturing her femur on the bike last spring. “I don’t get these warning signs. Things just go with me.” She is now producing natural periods – her first one came last year – after wondering what would happen if she came off HRT without telling her doctor.   She recalls one of her early ones when her body “went to town” during a training session in the velodrome, emerging from the changing rooms with tampons “proudly stuffed down her skinsuit like bullet cartridges”. Clay does not know if she is ovulating despite having natural cycles now. But she is on a mission to raise more awareness about the invisible condition and be a voice for those whose sporting dreams have also been crushed. “I want people to know that you don’t have to be in the grips of an eating disorder to struggle with this problem. You can have a really great relationship with food, but not take note of how much energy you’re spending compared to how much you’re putting in. “Women have a massive alarm bell with periods – men don’t have that – so they can keep travelling to a point where their body breaks. Women should utilise that alarm bell.”   One of Britain’s leading Olympic sports scientists has warned a “medals over menstrual cycles” approach in elite sport is damaging female athletes’ reproductive health. Dr Emma Ross, who has spent more than a decade working in high performance sport, believes sportswomen are not being educated about long-term implications of Relative Energy Deficiency in Sport (RED-s). The syndrome occurs in athletes who underfuel according to their training demands, leaving them with low energy availability.   In women, this can lead to menstrual dysfunction, such as missed periods, which can disrupt the production of oestrogen, which is essential for maintaining bone density. Norway is the only country in the world which has set specific limits that prevent athletes with RED-s from competing. An athlete’s BMI, fat percentage and bone density is not allowed to fall below a certain level, while a woman must not miss her period for more than six months. “RED-s is reversible if caught and treated, but we’re not sure how it impacts long-term fertility,” Dr Ross said. “There is some evidence that when a woman misses periods for a long time, there is some damage to her reproductive health. Even when their periods come back after months – sometimes years – because they’ve adjusted their training and nutrition, they might not be ovulating.”   Dr Ross said Britain’s Olympic and Paralympic system must be “really mindful” of having a duty of care towards female athletes experiencing RED-s in a similar way to rugby’s management of head injuries. A UK Sport spokesperson said: “UK Sport, in partnership with the English Institute of Sport, is committed to ensuring that all funded athletes have access to the very best sports science and medical support. Integrity, welfare and effective performance culture are at the heart of our high-performance community and how we win is more important than what we win on the global stage.  “We want our community to be known internationally for its people-first approach and for upholding the highest standards of welfare and integrity.”   English Institute of Sport, meanwhile, say they have taken a 'world-leading approach in this area establishing an Athlete Health directorate in 2017 to proactively address physical and mental priorities'. They added: “This includes a dedicated female athlete health team, workstream and associated SmartHER campaign that encompasses several areas of work, one of which is aimed at normalising conversation around the menstrual cycle. “However, as with so many areas of health, there is always more that can be done, and we continue to seek ways to further support UK high performance system athletes.”  "

Abi Burton exclusive interview: 'I had muscles bigger than most boys at high school - and got picked on because of it'
","
Burton has decided to speak out on what were torrid teenage years over body-shape bullying in the hope that her revelations will help others
",Kate Rowan,"
29 March 2021 • 8:00am
","Abi Burton is very specific about what she wants to wear for the portraits that will accompany this interview. Often, sportspeople will want to make sure that they are showing off the logo of a sponsor, but Burton’s choice has a much deeper meaning. She is keen to wear a crop top decorated with Japanese cherry blossom. The pattern symbolises what she hopes will be her journey to the Tokyo Olympics with Great Britain Sevens, but of more significance is how much of herself the garment reveals, while she stands outside on a chilly, blustery morning in Acton. Burton, 21, wants to show that after years of suffering from body-dysmorphia and crippling self-doubt she is ready to demonstrate to the world how proud she is of her body – a professional rugby player’s body. It was not always this way. Burton had a happy childhood growing up in the rugby league heartland of Castleford, where it was clear she and her younger twin brothers Joe and Oliver were destined to take after their father, Danny, formerly of Halifax and Bradford Bulls. However, after ditching league for gymnastics, athletics and swimming, Burton decided to return to her rugby roots as puberty hit. This is where her problems began. “I had inherited my dad’s muscular genes,” she recalls. “In sport, people would absolutely love to have the ability to put on muscle mass so easily. But as a young girl going through high school and puberty, it wasn’t something I was very proud of. It was something I wanted to hide from the ages of 13 to this day.” Burton has decided to speak out on what were torrid teenage years in the hope that her revelations will help others. Hence, her decision to have her photo taken looking exactly as she does in training – no airbrushing, and no doctoring. Rugby was her escape while she was tormented about her appearance in school. “I didn’t hate how I looked on a rugby pitch but I hated how I looked in normal clothes,” she says. “I could not cope with how l looked in a dress. “I didn’t fit in at all. I stuck out like a sore thumb! I had bleach-blonde hair and was five foot seven at the age of 13, with muscles bigger than the majority of the boys in my high school. I got picked on because of it. “And it wasn’t by other girls – it was by boys and that shocked me a little bit more that the boys would feel that way. I was more broad, I looked bigger in a school shirt and from that I got comments like, ‘She looks like a man’, ‘flabby Abi’, ‘she’s a bloke’, ‘why is she going in the girls changing rooms because she looks like a bloke?’” Burton is part of Generation Z, a cohort who seem even more comfortable than their millennial predecessors at talking about societal issues, but these taunts still cut to the quick. “It may sound really superficial but between the ages of 13 and 18, you feel really self-conscious but you just want to fit in and be liked by the boys if you are straight, all I wanted was to be liked by the boys,” she says. “Now, that I look back on it is what society instils into us to be approved by males, that is what you’re taught between 13 to 18. “I have come away from it and grown up and realised it is a product of society. All I wanted was to be liked and when people are constantly bashing your appearance it has a negative effect on you mentally.” Burton was desperate to hide her pain, with only her mother knowing the depth of her anguish. Shopping trips to the White Rose shopping centre in Leeds seems to have caused much more stress than representing her country. “My mum used to take me out shopping to buy me a whole new outfit, so I would feel confident enough going to a party. On the day of the party I would be really upset saying I didn’t want to go because ‘I look fat, all the other girls are tiny, they have thigh gaps, no one looks like me.’ “I would just cry in my bedroom. My mum did everything that she could; we used to spend so long trying to find me a new outfit to try to make me feel better. And then sometimes, I still wouldn’t be able to go.” But this was only the surface of Burton’s anguish. Her voice breaks as she begins to describe how she used binge eating as a coping mechanism. This led to occasional purging, which she has never spoken publicly about before. “When I was at my most down, I would eat and eat and eat and eat. And then I would feel sick and I would make myself throw up,” she says, her voice breaking. “At the time, I didn’t think it was much of an issue but it probably was a big issue. I don’t feel that way anymore because I don’t go down a binge eat spiral very often – sometimes when I don’t get selected. The last time I properly binge ate was when I didn’t get selected for the Olympic qualifiers in 2019. I went home and ate my feelings and then pulled myself together.” A turning point for Burton was joining the England sevens programme in 2018 and she credits the support of World Cup winner Natasha Hunt in guiding her towards her journey to body positivity. “I wore a swimming costume while all the other girls wore bikinis and I remember Ellie Kildunne, who is a close friend, telling me to wear a bikini. I told her I didn’t feel comfortable. She said no one would care. I sheepishly walked downstairs in my bikini. No one cared. I then spoke to Natasha Hunt and told her I felt self-conscious because my skin folds were higher than everybody else’s. She told me that no one cared what I looked like as long as I performed well on the pitch. For her to say that to me was everything I needed. From that moment I decided to share my story.” So, Burton went on Instagram and set up a page showing what the body of a real athlete looks like, eschewing social media norms of filtered and posed photos. She also credits the story of her maternal great-grandfather, who fought in the British Army during the Second World War, as providing inspiration through his experience as a Jewish prisoner of war. Many of her former bullies are now her friends and are proud to have gone to school with a potential Olympian. One ally is Leeds United player and former classmate Jamie Shackleton, who has been a huge source of strength. “Jamie never said anything cruel, he was always a good mate. It is brilliant to have a friend who is also trying to make it to the top in sport, it is great having him there as he gets it.” There is no doubt Burton has a bright future ahead but she wants her purpose to be more than just that of a rugby player. “Someone can tell you how great you look but unless you believe them, then it doesn’t matter what other people say. There are still days when I don’t believe people when they tell me I look well. I felt I was in a place where I could talk about my body. I know I am not the finished article. I know I am still going through my journey but I needed to get it out there because of the amount of girls out there who feel the same way I felt. “My page isn’t for me to show off my body, I just want to feel like I am liberating women so they can be open and honest about their body.”"

The unstoppable rise of the 'super shoe' - and how it caused 'mayhem' in athletics
","
Experts reveal how much improvement these shoes provide as Telegraph Sport looks at which world records are now in danger of being broken
","Ben Bloom, ","
3 March 2021 • 7:30am
","By the start of 2020, it was evident something was afoot. By World Athletics president Seb Coe’s admission, the governing body had “been chasing the horse around the paddock” in failing to react quickly enough to developments in road-running shoes and it was too late. Nike’s technological innovations had changed the marathon landscape forever and no elite runner would ever take the start line again without some combination of carbon fibre and hyper-responsive foam under the soles of their feet. The horse had bolted. Now the governing body had a secondary problem of attempting to shut the door on the same happening on the track. Little more than a year on, its failure to do so has been brought into sharp focus and threatened to overshadow much of what will take place at the Olympics this summer. Courtesy of previously unheralded athletes making headlines with astounding performances during the indoor season, fissures that had been bubbling under the surface have developed into full-blown divisions as debate blights the sport and world records become sitting ducks. Behind it lies a secretive world of non-disclosure agreements, cutting-edge technology and warring shoe companies, battling to help runners achieve feats many thought impossible. Many people, including some within the footwear industry, believe it should never have come to this. Until January 2020, regulations on sole thickness had only ever existed in the high jump and long jump, with most track spikes so thin and lightweight that further limitations were not necessary. But with shoe companies seeing the radical impact of marrying carbon-fibre plates with super-springy foam, prototypes for middle- and long-distance track spikes had emerged a few months earlier at the 2019 World Championships that suggested all that was about to change and limitations were quickly needed. Where track spikes had rarely exceeded 15 millimetres in thickness in the past, World Athletics introduced a blanket 30mm sole thickness rule, later amended to 25mm for all track events beyond 400 metres. The reason for not going thinner was the existence of one particular thick-soled Nike spike rarely worn outside the American collegiate system. “That was what created everything you see now,” one leading shoe company executive told  . “It means you have all this room for plates and bounceability. “The parameters are out of control. They should never have been what they are, but now we have them we are going to work with them. “We’re going to have a period of two or three years where you have phenomenal athletes - let’s not belittle them - that are given a product that is definitely going to make them run faster. There will be faster times and records falling. In the short term it’s going to be mayhem.” Barely an athletics competition has gone by this year without proof. Fresh from new women’s 5,000m, and men’s 5,000m and 10,000m world records during last year’s brief outdoor season, the past month has seen times continue to tumble in middle and long-distance events. One men’s 3,000m race saw a 23-year-old world record missed by just 0.08 seconds as the first four Nike-sponsored finishers all moved into the top eight of the all-time world rankings. Nike-sponsored British athlete Elliot Giles, who has never reached a world final, smashed Coe’s national 800m record by more than a second with the second-fastest indoor time in history. And Nike-sponsored Marc Scott took 46 seconds off his 10,000m personal best to move second behind only Mo Farah on the all-time British rankings. For many people - and no one more than the athletes themselves - the astonishing performances are reflective of hard work in training, the rare benefit of time during global Covid lockdowns, and peaking at the start of an Olympic year. But all have revolutionary shoes as a common factor. The fast times of the past are destined to be consigned to history. As Geoff Burns, a biomechanics expert at the University of Michigan, says: “It’s like there are these gems that through all of our history we thought were super rare but now we’ve found a deposit of them that makes them a little bit less valuable. “This year will be the equivalent of the move from cinder to all-weather tracks. It’s a generational shift.” Olympian and scientist Shalaya Kipp knew she was witnessing something that would change the marathon picture forever the moment she began “top-secret” testing of the latest Nike prototype road-running shoes. It was early 2016 and the first edition of what would become the Nike Vaporfly 4% was being put through its paces at the University of Colorado. Kipp, along with everyone else in the laboratory, was made to sign a non-disclosure agreement, preventing loose tongues causing details of the secret shoe to emerge. “We started referring to the prototype as ‘The Magic’ in the lab because it was crazy,” says Kipp. “It improved the running economy of every single participant we put in these shoes. It didn’t matter if they hated the shoe or not. The smallest change we saw was two per cent and the biggest six per cent.” There were two key components that marked the shoe out for such controversial greatness: a carbon-fibre plate and a new super-responsive foam. While the former was nothing new in isolation - carbon-fibre plates had been used in road-running shoes for well over a decade - it was the interaction with the new Pebax foam (which Nike called ZoomX) that changed everything. “For a long time we had EVA (ethylene-vinyl acetate) foams and they were pretty bad,” explains Wouter Hoogkamer, assistant biomechanics professor at the University of Massachusetts. “They were either soft and so you lost all the energy, or they had to be made really firm so you didn’t lose it. The result was minimal thicknesses for road shoes and track spikes. “Adidas came along with Boost foam around 2013, which allowed a softer foam that gave more energy return. Now with the Pebax foam you have even more of that.” A few months after the laboratory testing, the men’s Olympic marathon produced a Nike podium clean sweep through Kenya’s Eliud Kipchoge, Feyisa Lilesa of Ethiopia and American Galen Rupp. Disguised to look like the rest of the existing Nike footwear range, all three men were in fact secretly wearing the Vaporfly 4% prototype. “We were watching and knew exactly what was going on,” says Kipp. What happened next is well-known. Almost every podium at every major marathon between 2017 and 2019 was filled by Nike-sponsored athletes in Vaporfly 4% and Next% shoes, with some athletes affiliated to other companies attempting to paint over the Nike branding after jumping ship to use their rival’s shoes. Kipchoge would first smash the world record in 2018, before donning the latest iteration of the shoe - the Alphafly - to become the first man to run a marathon in less than two hours, albeit under highly-controlled conditions. Nike athlete Brigid Kosgei also obliterated Paula Radcliffe’s longstanding women’s marathon world record. Athletes running in rival shoes simply stood no chance. “It was guns versus knives,” says Burns. Asked for their reaction to such inequality, Nike make no apologies for their ability to produce better shoes than their rivals. “Plates, foam and air are not new ingredients in running shoes or spikes, we’re just smarter about how we engineer and assemble them,” a spokesperson told  . Four years on, the situation is rather different, with other shoe companies catching up. Three of the four winners at last December’s Valencia Marathon and Half-Marathon wore the Adizero Adios Pro, which uses carbon-infused rods laid out to mimic the skeleton under the forefoot, and a carbon-fibre plate in the heel. One of the athletes, Kibiwott Kandie, broke the half-marathon world record. After years of a mismatch between Nike road-running shoes and the rest, New Balance, Reebok, Saucony, On, Brooks, Hoka and Asics have now all released their own ‘super shoes’. The playing field is distorted from history, but it once again vaguely resembles something level among current athletes. “There really hasn’t been a ton of innovation in track products for a long time,” says Danny Orr, New Balance general manager for running technology. “It’s always been a little bit around, ‘can it weigh as little as possible’ and, ‘can it have as much traction as possible’. “For as long as I’ve been doing this, that’s all that has come the way of track athletes. So it does feel for the first time in 20 years there’s innovation in this space, which is exciting.” While the outside world was  , shoe companies had realised the technological advances could now be used to conquer the second frontier of track athletics. Prototypes, primarily from Nike, using the same technology began appearing with semi-regularity after Rupp is believed to have worn a pair in finishing fifth at the 2016 Rio Olympics. By the 2019 World Championships, the finished product was almost complete with a number of Nike athletes - including gold medal winners Sifan Hassan and Donavan Brazier - producing outstanding performances in prototype shoes that would later turn into the Air Zoom Victory, with its carbon-fibre plate and air pod, and ZoomX Dragonfly, which features a rigid Pebax plate. World Athletics had a decision to make. Track competition was on the brink of following road running, which had been blighted by accusations of technological doping. The question was whether the sport should follow the lead of swimming, which banned Speedo’s shark-inspired suits that saw world records tumble in 2008, or the likes of cycling, which encourages innovations in bikes, suits and helmets. An added factor for the governing body was balancing what many perceived as the integrity of pure competition against the requirements of the shoe companies that provide athletics its main source of income. “There is a built-in dynamic, where shoe companies mercifully are still investing a lot of money into the research and development of shoes,” said Coe, who relinquished a long-term Nike ambassadorial role in 2015. “I’m pleased they are doing that.” Under pressure from Nike, World Athletics opted for a 20mm sole thickness limit on events up to 400m and 25mm for longer distances. “They didn’t need to go to that extreme, but Nike argued there was already a shoe of that thickness in existence,” said one leading sports brand executive. “That was not a shoe that anyone wore in elite competition, but Nike said it had been worn at college level in America, so that was the basis for the rules we now have.” Another shoe company executive said: “Brands are always going to innovate. Half the blame is laid at the feet of our international governing body who have not set the best guidelines for the last couple of years on shoe tech. “We knew back in 2016/17 that this was coming through so they could have set ground rules right from the start. It was only 2020 that this started getting put in place and it’s still a moving feast.” Having taken charge of athletics at a time when it was riddled with corruption and doping scandals, there remains a sense that Coe and his staff were simply unable to prioritise the shoe issue until it was too late. A World Athletics spokesperson said: “Perhaps we should have responded quicker by bringing the shoe companies together, as we did in late 2019, but we would have followed the same process and set the same principles we are working to now. “Our role as the regulator of our sport includes embracing innovation that helps athletes train and perform to their talented best whilst balancing that with fair play and reasonable access to new technology. “Against a backdrop of light touch regulation in the past it was always going to take time for a critical mass of the race results to work through to a point where World Athletics felt it was time to intervene in a more proactive manner.” On the 25mm limit, they added: “The maximum track shoe height was 25mm for a shoe that had been widely used for many years and was still being used across the athlete college system in the USA.” For those who have benefited from Nike’s spikes, it is galling to hear suggestions that the footwear is responsible for their achievements. Giles described such statements as an “insult”, while Scott said sceptics should get off their “high horse” after his huge 10,000m personal best. Others have been more forthcoming. Adidas-sponsored Jamie Webb, who also went under Coe’s old British record wearing ‘old technology’ spikes when finishing second behind Giles this month, said the evidence shows “we are entering a new era”. New Zealand’s double Olympic 1,500m medalist Nick Willis, who no longer has a footwear contract, last month revealed he ran a 1,200m time trial two seconds quicker than he expected when trying out New Balance’s carbon-fibre Fuelcell MDx spikes. “I’m a believer in the new spike tech,” he said. “Far different to anything I have run in for my 20 years racing the mile.” To date, only New Balance and Nike have provided athletes with ‘super spikes’ in competition over the past 12 months, with Joshua Cheptegei and Letesenbet Gidey smashing world records in the Nike ZoomX Dragonfly last summer. But any sense of inequality looks likely to be quashed by this summer, with Adidas, Brooks and Puma among shoe manufacturers due to bring out new ranges for the outdoor season featuring the carbon-fibre and super-responsive foam combination. While various numerical estimates have been thrown around, the question remains over exactly how much improvement the shoes provide, especially given the surprising identity of some of the athletes producing such remarkable times this winter: Giles has never made a global final, while two unheralded US college students catapulted themselves to seventh and eighth on the all-time indoor mile list. Asked if there was any sense of percentage improvements, Nike simply said: “We are pleased with the results we have seen to date.” Indeed, it is difficult to put a precise figure on it. So too with the often-compared move from cinder to all-weather tracks in the 1960s. Biomechanists believe that change provided around a 1.5 per cent advantage, but such was the effect of weather conditions on the cinder that there is no definitive number. Of the spikes, Hoogkamer explains: “For marathon running, we can deduce that if you run a marathon at a certain pace you can do trials in six different shoes in the lab setting. But running 800m race pace is hard enough once, so you can’t do the same trial comparisons. “The other thing is the marathon relies on aerobic capacity, which we can measure through oxygen uptake. For these middle-distances you get a huge amount of anaerobic contributions, which we still don’t know how to quantify. So measuring running economy at middle-distance race pace misses out all the anaerobic contributions. There’s no lab measure.” Orr concurs it is “harder to put your finger on” due to the difficulty in measuring, but says the New Balance spikes produce “some of the most consistent data we’ve seen”. All signs suggest what we have seen is just the start. Burns says the difference produced by this new shoe technology will likely prove more noticeable on the track than it has been on the road, forcing us to recalibrate how we perceive certain times. “For starters, you race a lot more so the data set is larger,” he said. “And the conditions are hyper-controlled. On the roads you have lots of external factors to deal with and people tend to race only twice a year. “In running we have associations with certain times - we have intrinsic connections to clocked performances. We’re basically seeing the distribution of those performances shift. “What that means is the performances we associate with being rare and exciting are going to be a little less rare. Very quickly we are going to come habituated to those times becoming a bit less special.” A second horse has bolted. World Athletics is currently looking into creating a formula that measures energy return, to potentially impose limitations through that route - rather than specific physical constraints - in the future. How to implement such regulations is tricky though, and such is the time-lag in shoe production that any radical rule changes would likely take years to put in place. The spikes are here to stay and will dominate middle- and long-distance races at the Tokyo Olympics, although with technological advances yet to be fully harnessed in sprint disciplines the likes of Usain Bolt’s 100m world record looks safe for now. Nike’s innovative Viperfly sprint spike unveiled last year is believed to have   but did not adhere to World Athletics regulations and has now been ditched having never been used in competition. A new legal version may yet appear before the Olympics, and New Balance - whose Fuelcell SDx spikes have helped Holland’s Femke Bol run the four fastest 400m times in Europe this year - also have designs on making a new short sprint spike legal by the Tokyo Games. Coe, who set 12 world records during his career, remains sanguine - publicly, at least - about complaints that the spikes make a mockery of comparisons with previous eras, insisting, “we shouldn’t be in the business of trying to suffocate innovation”. He said: “I don’t think we've reached that point where world records are being handed out like confetti. World records do matter. They need to be cherished. They need to be things that the world looks at and thinks, ‘That’s a new benchmark, and a suffusion of skill, talent, hard work and great coaching’. “There have been some technological advancements on what I was running in and what the generation before me was running in. If I slide down the ranking list, that’s the nature of sport.” One field of thought is that the new spikes will allow some suspect performances to be wiped from the record book with a preference for shoe-aided times over those potentially fuelled by performance-enhancing drugs. The implications could also be far wider than reducing elite times. Hoogkamer says the money that shoe companies input into training biomechanists will allow them to “help people with strokes to walk better, or find better prosthetics for people”. Others have pointed out that not only does the improved footwear help people with injury-prevention, but it also generates more interest in running and being active. “It’s beneficial for everyone,” says Hugo Chouissa, Brooks footwear merchandiser. Well, almost everyone. The record holders of yesteryear may well think differently."

X-rated rants, swingeing cuts and a manager on the brink - how Birmingham City descended into chaos
","
A decade after the finest moment in their history - the League Cup final win over Arsenal at Wembley - Birmingham are a club in tatters
",John Percy,"
12 February 2021 • 10:51am
","Welcome to the mad, bad world of Birmingham City, where the volatile chief executive has become notorious for swearing at officials, a once-vaunted academy is now threatened with closure and yet another manager is under growing pressure to prove he should keep his job. Almost exactly 10 years after the finest moment in their history - the League Cup final win over Arsenal at Wembley - Birmingham are a club in tatters. Having improbably escaped relegation in three of the last four seasons, they are circling the drain again and will need a dramatic intervention to prevent them being sucked into League One. For the fans who descended on Wembley in their thousands in 2011, there is now simply frustration and disillusionment with a club which appears to be losing its soul and identity. Aitor Karanka, their sixth permanent boss in four years, is under increasing scrutiny and defeat against Luton on Saturday could leave him facing the sack from Zhao Wenqing, one of the club’s more powerful directors. Karanka is an experienced manager in the division, after spells with Middlesbrough and Nottingham Forest, but there is no disguising his struggles at St Andrew's. The recent statistics paint a bleak picture of their survival chances: over the last 46 games - a full league season - Birmingham have accrued just 41 points, a lower total than any of the three clubs relegated last year, and they have not won at home since Oct 28, losing six of the last seven games. Yet it is behind the scenes where Birmingham seem to be unravelling, with controversial chief executive Xuandong Ren continuing to run the club seemingly unchallenged. During Ren’s tenure, he has appointed Harry Redknapp, Steve Cotterill, Garry Monk, Pep Clotet and now Karanka, but it seems no manager can navigate a path to progress amid the chaos. Ren, known at the club as ‘Dong’, was appointed in 2017 and is a hands-on operator who attended training at Wast Hills last season in full tracksuit. Long-serving senior employees, the fabric of the club, have mysteriously departed due to “Covid-19 reconstruction” and cutbacks over the past three years, including Julia Shelton, the club secretary for two decades, and financial director Roger Lloyd. Recruitment staff have been furloughed, while Karanka was allegedly staying at the plush Hampton Manor hotel, where the top suite costs £500 a night, for three months after his appointment. Ren had threatened to close the highly-regarded academy, which has recently produced the likes of  , Nathan Redmond and Demarai Gray, before an embarrassing U-turn. The uncertainty over the academy’s future has already resulted in the sale of 15-year-old Calum Scanlon to Liverpool. A number of other youngsters are being targeted by rival clubs. The influential academy manager Kristjaan Speakman recently left after 14 years to join Sunderland. On matchdays, Ren sits behind the dug-outs and can frequently be heard swearing and shouting at officials. At a recent match, a local radio station had to turn their effects microphone off as it was picking up Ren’s bad language, while in December he was fined £7,500 by the Football Association for confronting a referee after a defeat at Cardiff. Birmingham have also been  , which included the nine-point deduction in the 2018/19 season. Figures also show the club to be more than £100million in debt. Lockdown and the absence of fans has arguably saved Ren from further scrutiny, yet there is mounting fury over the perceived lack of accountability and football knowledge around the club. Ren is 39 this month and his Birmingham future could be intrinsically linked to Karanka: he is understood to have told the board and chairman it was an appointment that could take them back to the Premier League.  In fairness, Ren has backed Karanka with funds in the transfer market this season as they began a proposed three-year project. But a recent 0-0 draw at bottom club Wycombe, where Karanka’s decision to make only one substitution left fans bewildered, suggested simply avoiding relegation should be the priority this season. The general consensus is that unless there is a change of regime the future does not bear thinking about. Birmingham have not operated in the third tier since the 1994/95 season, a time of Barry Fry, Steve Claridge, Ian Bennett and Kevin Francis. It used to be Aston Villa who circled the plughole, before they were eventually relegated in 2016: now it is their Second City rivals who are scrapping to avoid a similar fate."

Martin Johnson tribute: A press box legend who brought laughter wherever he travelled
","
The former Daily Telegraph journalist died aged 71 after a long illness and will be remembered as one of the trade's great raconteurs
","Simon Briggs, ","
15 March 2021 • 1:12pm
","The last time I spoke to Martin Johnson over the phone, I found myself crying with laughter on the train into London. It was a familiar experience for those lucky enough to know the ultimate raconteur of British sport – a man who was even funnier in person than he was in print. Johnson - who has died at the age of 71 - wrote for the Daily Telegraph between 1995 and 2008. It was the centrepiece of a magnificent career that began at the Leicester Mercury in the 1970s and also included sizeable stints at the Independent - where he made his first foray into Fleet Street - and latterly at the Sunday Times. Even amidst the eccentricities of the press box, Johnson was one of a kind: a correspondent who could skewer the shortcomings of a team or athlete as accurately as any straight news reporter, yet do it while simultaneously triggering a belly laugh. He had so many great moments, but the stand-outs tend to involve England cricket tours, for that was the sport which prompted his finest work. In the winter of 1986-87, as Mike Gatting’s Ashes tourists stumbled through their warm-up matches, he famously wrote that “There are only three things wrong with this England team: they can’t bat, they can’t bowl and they can’t field.”  When I rang him in 2017, while preparing a historical piece on Gatting’s Ashes, he expressed wonderment at the way his quip has lived on. “It’s extraordinary how the “Can’t bat, can’t bowl, can’t field” thing survives, like finding somebody’s teeth in a pile of ashes,” said Johnson, who was used to being asked to wheel out his memories of the tour. “It must be like being an impressionist, like Alistair McGowan, and being asked to do your Harold Wilson every time you go to dinner.” The other central story from his days on the cricket trail dates from the 1996-97 tour of Zimbabwe - a particularly ill-fated trip - where his clear-eyed questioning provoked the then England coach David “Bumble” Lloyd into a notorious outburst. “England had just drawn with Zimbabwe with scores level,” recalled Peter Hayter, a great friend of Johnson’s who was then covering cricket for the Mail on Sunday. “The mood at the post-match press conference was prickly, to put it mildly. Mike Atherton [then England captain] was eyeballing Martin, and Bumble suddenly burst out saying ‘We flippin’ murdered ’em, everybody knows that.’ Martin had the last laugh, as ever. He wrote that ‘When you’re murdering a person it’s advisable to make sure they’re no longer breathing.’” As it happened, Atherton simmered down and knocked on Johnson’s door that evening with a bottle of wine, which they shared in a mood of reconciliation. And neither was he the only England captain to make up with Johnson in this way after reacting angrily to one of his barbs. David Gower - a man so easy-going that he would sometimes be viewed as a dilettante - was once moved to threaten litigation over the suggestion that his leadership might be improved by a frontal lobotomy “Even I, having known him so long, took exception,” recalled Gower, whose apprenticeship at Leicestershire had coincided with Johnson’s days on the county beat. “We got a lawyer to write a letter to the sports editor of the Independent threatening to close them down if an apology wasn’t made. Martin rang me, said ‘What’s going on?’ I said ‘I want a bottle of champagne, make it a magnum. I want you to deliver it to my home and then we can drink it. It was a suitably amicable settlement out of court, and certainly didn’t cloud our friendship. “Martin was a writer of great skill, and he wrote primarily to entertain himself,” added Gower. “He was also fiercely independent and wasn’t afraid to put the boot in. Mike Turner [Leicestershire’s chief executive] would look enviously at Leicester City football club up the road and note that when they lost 6-0, the report would say they were unlucky, because the football reporter was almost a PR man on the club staff. Turner once asked me to speak to Martin about it, but as soon as we got to the bar for a chat, he turned to me and said ‘Quiet word – if it’s about what I am writing for the Mercury, don’t bother.’” Johnson was not famed as a news-getter - and indeed within the press box he was known ironically as “Scoop”. He could be accident-prone, as when the Telegraph sent him to cover a heavyweight boxing bout between Lennox Lewis and Ray Mercer. Having arrived at the MGM Grand in Las Vegas in search of his ring-side seat, Johnson was told that he was at the wrong venue, and the fight was way out east. “East side of town?” he replied. “No sir, east as in East Coast.” It was actually being staged in New York. Yet he was certainly much more than just a gags man. He was an astute observer of sport in general, and an enthusiastic participant - particularly on the golf course, where his distinctive, Sid James-ish cackle would ring out whenever a shot went astray. “Our games with Chris Lander [the former Daily Mirror cricket correspondent] and others were often comedy classics,” recalled Hayter. “I’ve seen him laugh so hard that he would literally clutch his sides in pain.” That was my experience, too, when I last rang him and he re-enacted a scene from the 1987 cricket World Cup involving the food parcels that Tesco sent to the England team to keep their spirits up through five weeks on the Indian sub-continent. “There was a giant wheel of camembert, which mysteriously disappeared into Mike Gatting’s hotel room,” Johnson recalled. “John Emburey was banging on the door, saying ‘He’s got the cheese in there!’” At the time, Gatting might occasionally have felt exasperated by Johnson’s one-liners - which included the observation that “How anyone can spin a ball the width of Gatting boggles the mind” after Shane Warne’s wonder-ball of 1993. But he has fond memories of “a man with a very sharp, very dry sense of humour. The press used to put on a little play or sketch show at Christmas, when we travelled to Australia, and Martin used to write all the best lines.” There were so many to choose from. Johnson was particularly good on run-ups. For Merv Hughes, he wrote that “his mincing run-up resembles someone in high heels and a panty girdle chasing after a bus,” while Angus Fraser “looked like a man who had got his braces caught on the sightscreen.” , who - at the height of the 1990 panic over Bovine Spongiform Encephalitis - was described as suffering from “a virulent case of Boiling Scotsman Eruptus”. I can only encourage lovers of Johnson’s prose to search out his books - there are collections both of his rugby and cricket writing available second-hand, while a more recent compendium   was published by Constable in 2015.  Johnson died at the weekend after a long illness. Few men in our business have brought so much joy to so many."

John Inverdale: culture war casualty or right time for a fresh face at BBC?

Rugby man is leaving his role as BBC main union presenter in favour of a gig on the RFU council
",Alan Tyers,"
29 March 2021 • 3:07pm
","Farewell then, John Inverdale: you were always more of a rugby man and, in the immortal words of David Brent, you admit it. The departure of Inverdale from the BBC Rugby anchor role (this Six Nations will be his last as host) is a classic modern example of the facts being dependent on your perspective. Which truth, then, shall we speak of Invers? For some people, and clearly for the BBC that used him front and centre in its rugby coverage for 30 years, he was a quality professional: assured, able to bring out the best in his pundits, knowledgeable about the sport but without attempting to make the debate about him. He was part of that multi-sport generation of BBC radio-and-TV all-rounder, popping up on Cheltenham, golf, Wimbledon, rowing, Olympics and anything else where middle-class people might be on the premises. And he existed in that space somewhere between sports broadcast journalist and personality, the space occupied by Clare Balding, say, or . The younger generation probably has to work harder, for less exposure, and certainly across more platforms. And there is now more of a separation between the army of broadcast journo grafters, shiny, tough toilers with a journalism post-grad; and the star-name talent such as yer Alex Scotts or the Isa Guhas of this world, with the ex-professional sportsperson much the preferred option for the big chairs. Decent pair of shoes, navy blazer, but NB open-necked shirt, and a tie tucked into the jacket pocket in case entry is required to one of the smarter enclosures with the possible promise of something cold and refreshing, Inverdale looks like the sort of chap who has generally, traditionally been in charge of things. He might be the BBC anchor at the Ryder Cup, he might be the CEO of a medium-sized estate agent chain, a semi-retired partner in a law firm. Authority, assurance, a safe pair of hands. Not a toff, but he knows which fork to use. Regarded as a good egg by many, incidentally. Now 63, he was born within the ideal era to have an excellent career as a somewhat famous person on the BBC, when the large majority of society was still used to people like Invers telling them what is what, and generally accepting that. But times have changed. The will forever dog him, and there were others: implying that Kate Middleton didn’t know the rules of rugby, getting . In and of themselves, these were either extemporaneous blunders or totally unacceptable sexism: each of us will have our own point of view. But the point is that something coalesced around Inverdale, who came to represent a certain sort of person  . Or at least not on the telly: lest anyone either lament or crow that he has been cancelled, rest assured that he has slid comfortably into a job on the rugby council, where there are no doubt all the rubber chicken dinners you can eat as long as you can stand the meetings. It was interesting to watch the BBC Saturday night rugby coverage recently in which Inverdale hosted Martin Johnson, Sam Warburton and Jamie Roberts and catch oneself thinking: “How often do you see a studio panel with 100 per cent representation of four white chaps in blazers?” For some of us, the answer will be “still too bloody often”. For others, the answer will be “that’s the way I like it”. For Invers, there will still be Wimbledon. Whether there will always be an England is less immediately clear, but then he’s not the only one with that to ponder. "

sport,,,,,"The prospect of a first ever official women's club world cup appears closer than ever, after the body representing Europe's biggest teams gave the idea in principle its backing. The European Club Association, which is recognised as the voice for clubs at European level,  including a pledge to “thoroughly evaluate the possible introduction of a Club World Cup”. The men's club version has been well-established since the turn of the millennium, but its dominance by the sole European representative each year has made it somewhat tedious and repetitive. A women's club version would be far more competitive, not least because more than one continent has a serious chance of providing the eventual winner, something that'd you'd hope was a given from any 'world' competition. Women's football can offer a genuinely wide-open battle to be crowned world champions. That suggestion is not a new one - after the success of the 2019 World Cup in France,  e “as soon as possible”, and planning is said to still be ongoing, but similar promises have been made in the past and fans have been kept waiting. However, in light of the women’s game’s current momentum, and now potentially the influential ECA onboard, this time things feel different, so how realistic is a women’s club world cup in the near future and why would it be such an important step? First and foremost, a club world cup feels much, much more relevant for the women’s game than the men’s, for one very simple reason. In men’s football, 13 of the past 14 winners have come from Europe, including seven victories shared between dominant Spanish giants Real Madrid and Barcelona. When it is such a foregone conclusion that the  , personally I find it hard to describe that particular annual procession as anything other than very boring. Yet in the women’s game, the strength of leagues on other continents makes the prospect of a women’s version of this tournament far, far more unpredictable and exciting for neutrals. America’s NWSL has long had the greatest strength in depth of any women’s division, while Australia’s W-League and Japan's Nadeshiko League could also offer strong contenders, along with high-calibre challengers from Europe, where the women’s game’s growth has accelerated dramatically in modern times. International teams have shown this already, with the men’s World Cup having been won four times in a row by European nations whereas three different continents have produced winners of the past four women’s world cups: Germany in 2007, Japan in 2011 and then back-to-back world titles for the record four-time winners the United States. A club tournament wouldn't be without its challenges, not least because of the huge variations in the domestic calendars for the world's biggest women's leagues, but winning such an event would be a much greater achievement for women's team's than their male counterparts. The huge fanbase for the women's game in North America particularly also offers the tournament huge commercial potential. “There’s real excitement about this possibility right throughout the women’s football community,” said Claire Bloomfield, the ECA’s head of women’s football. There’s lots of enthusiasm for this. “We have a responsibility to explore all of the possible opportunities that can help grow the competition landscape. “It is difficult to determine exactly how quickly that could be in place but we’re very committed to tabling a very detailed proposition which outlines things like possible access lists, formats, ownership and so on.” The ECA’s chief executive Charlie Marshall added: “In the women’s game there is the potential to much more quickly develop global competitive balance. “I think Fifa’s ambition on the men’s club world cup is probably a 50-year ambition to try and even out that competitive (men’s) balance, and is a really tough one at that. The global competitive balance of the women’s game is a very different setup. “So the prospect of a club world cup fairly soon in the women’s game, assuming calendars can be resolved, is a really exciting one and I know Fifa are very keen on it as well.” The ECA, the body that represents clubs at a European level, have vowed to pursue “full-scale gender equality” in football, marking a significant shift in their priorities to focus more on women's football than in the past, and have outlined six goals in their first women’s football strategy. Those include driving a “sustainable future” for women’s football, conducting more research, accelerating professionalism, helping to create new women’s teams and to help clubs “realise their European ambitions”. The latter includes a reference to “explore the options for a possible second-tier competition that provides clubs with the opportunity to play more relevant games in Europe”. Yes, that could mean we are closer to seeing a women’s version of the Europa League. That’s something that Marshall describes as an “intriguing prospect”. Until now, such a tournament has not been seen as commercially viable realistically, with most of the countries across the continent still having only part-time women’s football divisions, in turn making international travel challenging. But the recent rise of big men’s brands such as Barcelona, Paris Saint-Germain, Chelsea, Manchester City and Juventus to challenge holders Lyon has brought an end to the dominance previously seen by Scandinavian and German clubs and is changing the landscape of the game on the continent completely. Not everybody would be happy to see women’s football simply mirror the men’s game when it comes to the brands that are ultimately lifting the major trophies, but the trickle-down impact of their big clubs’ investments offers immense possibilities for the wider sport."

 Personal insurance and French automobile manufacturer Following the departure of Romain Bardet who had spent his entire career at the team, Ag2r-Citroën's emphasis has shifted from targeting the general classification towards the classics and hunting for stages. While much will be expected from big-name signing Greg Van Avermaet, success may well come from in-house. Benoît Cosnefroy enjoyed a long spell in the mountains jersey at last year's Tour de France before taking podium places at La Flèche Wallonne, De Brabantse Pijl and Paris-Tours to underline what a talented and versatile rider the 25-year-old is. The arrival of Bob Jungels, a former winner at Liège-Bastogne-Liège and Kuurne-Bruxelles-Kuurne, will provide some much-needed firepower in the early spring classics and may even provide an option in the general classification. The capture of Ben O'Connor — who won a stage at last year's Giro d'Italia — on a one-year deal appears an astute acquisition. It was thin pickings for the French team in 2020: a solitary WorldTour win in the entire season when Nans Peters proved he was no one-hit wonder a year after winning from a breakaway at the Giro d'Italia. And what a follow up it was for the young Frenchman who, racing on home turf, dropped Ilnur Zakarin on the descent of the Peyresourde before soloing to the second win of his career during stage eight at the Tour. Ag2r-Citroën may have added 11 names to their roster, but it will take some time for many to get used to Bardet, 30, no longer riding for the team. The departure to DSM may well give Bardet a much-needed new lease of life, while his former employers will be hoping for a similar boost. Kazakhstan

 Kazakh consortium and Canadian biotechnology company Alexandre Vinokourov may end up rueing the loss of Miguel Ángel López, but one imagines the Kazakh will not have lost too much sleep during the close season given the remaining firepower he has at his disposal. One of the big concerns for Astana, possibly, is the age of the creaking squad, with a number of the big-name riders all edging towards the latter parts of their careers: Omar Fraile (30), the Izagirre brothers (Ion, 31 and Gorka, 33) and Luis León Sánchez (37) are all in their thirties, as is Jakob Fuglsang (35) who last year won his second monument at Il Lombardia. However, along with a number of youngsters that will bring some fresh blood into the squad, the 24-year-old Aleksandr Vlasov will be hoping to build on what turned into a frustrating season for the Russian. Impressive performances at La Route d'Occitanie and a victory at the Mont Ventoux Dénivelé Challenge, along with some good results at the Italian classics, were tempered by the disappointment of having to abandon the Giro d'Italia. Bounced back at the Vuelta a España where he finished second on the Angliru stage, though, underlining why many have tipped him to become the first Astana rider since Fabio Aru in 2015 to win a grand tour. In what turned out to be one of the most breathtaking Tours de France in living memory López, the rider that is nicknamed Superman in Colombia, left his rivals gasping for air on the vertiginous slopes of the col de la Loze. The 26-year-old may not have threatened the overall, but for one majestic afternoon he rode Primoz Roglic, Sepp Kuss and Tadej Pogacar off his wheel making all three look ordinary, which they are anything but. Though far from being the team's figurehead, the departure of López overshadows any of the incoming eight riders who are, broadly speaking, untried youngsters. ""They were six wonderful years, I grew up and learned a lot with them,"" said López following his transfer to Movistar. Bahrain

 Kingdom of Bahrain Despite having lost team principal Rod Ellingworth, who returned to Ineos Grenadiers after just one season at the Bahraini squad, the future may not be as grim as some have predicted for Bahrain Victorious in 2021. The arrival of Jack Haig should bolster Mikel Landa's grand tour ambitions, while the 27-year-old may be keen on taking a leadership role in the shorter one-week races. It is elsewhere, though, where the wins may come from for the intriguingly renamed Bahrain Victorious squad. Dylan Teuns, 28, has the power and climbing ability to cope on both the Belgian cobbles and Ardennes classics, while Heinrich Haussler (36) may also challenge in the spring classics. It is Fred Wright, though, that may be the team's darkest horse. Working below the radar, away from the spotlight placed on Ineos riders, the Londoner impressed as the grand tour debutant finished fourth during a stage of last year's Vuelta a España. Jan Tratnik's win at the Giro d'Italia came as a blessed relief for the team, it was a relief too for the Slovenian whose brother and girlfriend stood at the roadside near the finish line of stage 16 at San Daniele del Friuli. Tratnik rode a canny finale and dropped Ben O'Connor, who had earlier chased him down before the pair rode towards the finish together, on the last short and steep climb of the day to claim the biggest win of his career. Signed on a three-year contract from Mitchelton-Scott — renamed BikeExchange for 2021 — Haig, in theory, is a very smart signing. The Australian diesel will a key cog in the stage-race engine room and may even land a big one for himself if he is given the freedom to roam. Australia

Coming in the other direction, Amund Grondahl Jansen arrived from Jumbo-Visma, Tanel Kangert comes in from EF Pro Cycling, Michael Matthew returns and the team signed 21-year old Italian Kevin Colleoni. And so, what to expect in 2021? With 11 of their 27-man squad at or above the age of 30, the make-up of the team is starting to look very familiar and, quite possibly, a little tired. The likes of Simon Yates and Esteban Chaves, who despite the Colombian's boyish smile is 31, need to deliver big one-day wins or launch a serious general classification challenge in the grand tours. On a more positive note, the 24-year-old Lucas Hamilton showed glimpses of promise last year, with a Tirreno-Adriatico stage win. Back-to-back stage wins at Tirreno-Adriatico from Hamilton and Simon Yates were the highlights of what had been a disappointing season. A few days later, however, Yates won the general classification ahead of fellow Briton Geraint Thomas, making the Mitchelton-Scott rider one of the favourites for the Giro d'Italia. Unfortunately the Tirreno-Adriatico title in September was as good as it got for Yates and his team-mates. Having spent four seasons at Sunweb, the return of Matthews should bring some much-needed steel in the punchy one-day classics, while the Australian can go stage hunting at the Tour. Hopefully can offer the team some belief after losing Adam Yates to Ineos Grenadiers over the winter.  Germany

 Manufacturers of kitchen appliances & bathroom products Just weeks out from the start of the season new signing Wilco Kelderman, a general classification rider who finished third at last year's Giro d'Italia, and a group of team-mates were involved in a crash during a training camp near Lake Garda in northern Italy. It was the worst possible start for Kelderman; the worst start to the new year for Bora-Hansgrohe. Just under two weeks after Kelderman was left concussed and having sustained a fractured vertebrae — while Rüdiger Selig and Andreas Schillinger were all taken to hospital — it was Peter Sagan's turn to give his team a fright after he crashed while on a training camp on Gran Canaria. Things, one feels, can only get better for the luckless squad. While much of the focus will be on an ageing Sagan, the squad has plenty of firepower upon which it can rely, including their tried and tested trio of German riders Pascal Ackermann, Emanuel Buchmann and Maximilian Schachmann. Able to challenge, respectively, in the pure sprints, the Ardennes-style climbs and the high mountains, this trident will ensure the team is challenging across all terrains once racing is under way. Things did not look good for Sagan after he had finally loosened his vice-like grip on the green jersey at the Tour de France. With sharpened quills cycling's obituary writers prepared themselves as he headed to his maiden Giro. In Italy the once imperious Sagan looked . . . normal. During stage 10, though, he launched an audacious attack from some distance out in the lashing rain to claim one of his greatest wins. Pure  . A runners-up place at Paris-Roubaix and fifth at Tour of Flanders in 2019 would suggest that Nils Politt may well be the heir apparent to Sagan who, despite his brilliant win at the Giro, is a fading force. Which may be why Bora-Hansgrohe handed the 26-year-old Politt a three-year contract. France

 Money-lending company Following their return to the top tier of cycling, much was expected from Cofidis in 2020 following their high-profile signings of Italian sprinter Elia Viviani and French general classification contender Guillaume Martin. And then? Well, not much unfortunately. It was, in summary, a poor season for the French team whose wait for a stage win at the Tour de France was extended to 13 years having again fired blanks on home turf. In the countdown to the new season, it was reported that Elia Viviani had undergone surgery having experienced heart palpitations while on a training ride. Despite the setback, he confirmed his race schedule would go ahead as planned. ""My programme remains the same,"" he said. ""I’m calm and also determined to have the season of redemption that I need."" It is not, however, all doom and gloom for Cofidis. Martin will be hoping to build on what was a promising season, while the squad has enough talent to pick off the odd win once the stage races get under way. May struggle in the one-day classics, although the addition of Luxembourg rider Jempy Drucker may go some way to help in that department. While Attilio Viviani and Anthony Perez may claim their stage wins at La Tropicale Amissa Bongo and the Tour du Haut Var were highlights of the season, it was Martin's performance during the opening week of the Tour that impressed most. Third on stage four at Orcières-Merlette behind Primoz Roglic and Tadej Pogacar will have given the Frenchman plenty to mull over during the winter, and plenty to build on throughout 2021. Although he has just three wins on his  , veteran German Simon Geschke brings with him a wealth of experience. Though unlikely to add any money into Cofidis' prize pot, the 34-year-old will be a reliable  for leader Martin and is a more-than-capable road captain. Belgium

While losing their position as the world No 1-ranked team — a title the team held for two years straight before Jumbo-Visma toppled them — Deceuninck-Quick Step also failed to win a single monument. Though not unheard of, these races are the bread and butter of the Belgian team. Though packed with talent, will be fascinating to see how they cope with the likes of Mathieu van der Poel and Wout van Aert in the cobbled classics, the races where the Belgian team is expected to perform by both sponsors and its passionate fanbase in Flanders. In Julian Alaphilippe will be eyeing success in the Ardennes and stage two at the Tour, and praying Remco Evenepoel can return to action following his long-term lay-off and finally get his grand tour career under way at the Giro. Will be interesting to see how the team manage Joao Almeida who was, arguably, the breakthrough rider of 2020 after leading the Giro for two weeks. Going into the Giro few were familiar with Almeida. Three weeks later the 22-year-old was being talked of as a potential grand tour winner. Despite the successes of Evenepoel who won all four stage races he started, it was the way in which Almeida and his team-mates defended the   that impressed most. Honourable mention goes to young Briton James Knox who worked tirelessly for his team-mate's cause.

 Dutch multinational In terms of race wins — 16 at Continental and WorldTour level through nine different riders — 2020 was the best year the team had had since 2017 (18) which, given the truncated nature of the season, was impressive. It was the nature of those wins, though, that stood out most. Whether eyeing an early-season win at Paris-Nice, a stage at the Tour de France or a solo sortie in the Ardennes, the team's sporting directors had it covered. Technically and tactically the squad were practically faultless. Even at the Giro d'Italia where there was a slight wobble, 24-year-old Jai Hindley won the spectacular stage that traversed the Stelvio Pass before finishing second overall; his now former team-mate Wilco Kelderman third. The departure of Marc Hirschi in the new year may have cast a shadow over DSM's preparations for the season, but the arrival of Romain Bardet is a fascinating transfer. Whether or not the Frenchman is deployed as a general classification contender, a stage hunter in the big races or the hilly one-day classics remains to be seen, but one can only assume the brains behind one of the most exciting teams of the last year have a plan.  With impressive wins from Tiesj Benoot, Hindley, Hirschi, Soren Kragh Andersen it is a difficult one: take your pick. However, Kragh Andersen's first stage at the Tour was certainly the most entertaining. In another tactical masterclass from the team, Benoot attacked off the front before Hirschi went, followed by the Dane Kragh Andersen who soloed across the line to bring home the bacon with the biggest win of his career. Hirschi​'s departure from DSM on January 5 took almost everybody by surprise. Following his stellar breakthrough season in 2020 it was assumed the team would build around him. The young Swiss, though, had other plans and four days later joined UAE Team Emirates. Ouch. US

  Education company and Japanese construction company Enjoyed their best season since 2014, won stages in all three grand tours — with six different riders — and  to produce a one-off kit, with ducks on. All-in-all, a successful season then. Following a tricky few years, Jonathan Vaughters' squad has quietly and efficiently become a well-rounded and balanced outfit, able to challenge for stages and the classics. While the departures of Daniel Martínez (Ineos Grenadiers), Michael Woods and Sep Vanmarcke (Israel Start-up Nation) and Simon Clarke (Qhubeka-Assos) will certainly weaken them, the core of the squad appears strong enough to challenge throughout the season. In theory, lost more firepower than they brought in during the close season, but Hugh Carthy should bring the team further joy throughout 2021, while it will be interesting to monitor the ongoing development of promising young American climber Neilson Powless. While Ruben Guerreiro and Sergio Higuita can help in the mountains, Alberto Bettiol and Michael Valgren will spearhead the spring classics campaign. Along with Italian climbs the Mortirolo Pass and Monte Zoncolan, the Alto de l'Angliru in Asturias in northern Spain is considered one of the toughest ascents in world cycling. And so when Carthy won stage 12 at the Vuelta a España on this mythical climb the entire world took notice. The manner in which the 193cm tall Prestonian dropped some of the best climbers in the race was as impressive as it was breathtaking. EF Education-Nippo will be hoping that new signing Valgren can rediscover his 2018 form. However, making his team debut at Étoile de Bessèges the Dane suffered a huge setback following a crash in which he sustained fractures to the second and third metacarpals in his left hand. France

 French national lottery Take away the wins from sprinter Arnaud Démare and Stefan Küng and Kevin Geniets' national titles and Groupama-FDJ were left with just three wins in 2020, the opening stage at Étoile de Bessèges for Alexys Brunel and a pair for young climber David Gaudu at the Vuelta a España. Given the team is essentially a state-sponsored vehicle to advertise the French national lottery — run by individuals that think and act as civil servants, according to French journalist François Thomazeau — it is unlikely Marc Madiot is under pressure to deliver better results in 2021, though most observers will be hoping he can. It is safe to say that last year's Tour de France was an unmitigated disaster after the team's main general classification hope Thibaut Pinot crashed on stage one, while his No 2 Gaudu was anonymous having arrived off the back of an illness. With a largely unchanged squad, Madiot will be hoping that Pinot can challenge in either the Tour, or if reports are to be believed, the Giro d'Italia while Démare will, surely, make his return to the Grande Boucle. Démare may also be targeting the spring classics, along with Swiss time-trial specialist Küng who managed top-10 finishes last year at Omloop Het Nieuwsblad, Ghent-Wevelgem and Driedaagse Brugge-De Panne. Having been omitted from the Tour squad, Démare went on to win four stages at the Giro along with the points jersey. It was his victory on stage six, though, that stood head and shoulders above the rest. On an uphill drag that favoured the likes of Michael Matthews or Peter Sagan, Démare went from some distance out to take the stage and underline why many argued he was the best all-round sprinter of 2020. Only time will tell if allowing the talented Frenchman Marc Sarreau to join Ag2r-Citroën was a mistake or not. However, having cut short his season following his involvement in the crash that did for fellow sprinter Fabio Jakobsen at last year's Tour of Poland, his condition is unknown. Great Britain

 Sir Dave Brailsford 
 Multinational chemicals company It was a peculiar year for the British team, but one which saw Ineos Grenadiers earn some new fans after adopting a new-look brand racing. Admittedly, their swashbuckling style was largely enforced on them after team leaders Egan Bernal and Geraint Thomas prematurely departed the Tour de France and Giro d'Italia respectively, but it was nonetheless a welcome approach from a team long associated with metronomic racing. Having strengthened with Laurens De Plus, Daniel Martínez, Richie Porte and Adam Yates, Ineos Grenadiers would appear more than prepared for the challenge laid down by Jumbo-Visma and UAE Team Emirates at last year's Tour de France. The addition of British neo-pro Tom Pidcock, meanwhile, should give the squad the option to liven things up in the early season one-day races, while another young Briton Ethan Hayter appears on course to make a name for himself in the classics. It will be interesting to see how the team management approach the new season: do they continue in the same vein as 2020, or revert to type? Whatever is decided, in Thomas, Bernal, Richard Carapaz and Geoghegan Hart — their four former grand tour winners — they have the firepower to contest the biggest stage races, and enough talent across to board to challenge in the Ardennes classics. Chris Froome may have left, but the team's conveyor belt of talent is showing no sign of coming to a halt. Having arrived at the Giro d'Italia as  for team-mate Geraint Thomas, Geoghegan Hart was installed as a 225-1 outsider to win his first grand tour when the Welshman crashed out just three days into the race. Two stage wins and a   — that he sealed on the final day — later and the Londoner joined the sport's immortals. It was one of the feelgood stories of not only the cycling season, but of the sporting year too. The capture of Pidcock is a massive coup for Ineos Grenadiers. Not only is he one of the most promising talents in the world right now, but also one of the most versatile and exciting riders of a generation. Targeting the Ardennes and hopes to makes his grand tour debut at the Vuelta a España. Belgium

 Belgian food retailer and engineering companies The newest kids on the WorldTour block, Intermarché-Wanty-Gobert Matériaux, acquired their top-tier status having taken the licence from the now defunct CCC squad. They are also, on paper, one of the weakest. Despite having signed the vastly experienced Rein Taaramae (33), Jan Hirt (30), and Louis Meintjes (28), may struggle at making any sort of impact in the top level. However, will be hoping to challenge for stages and getting into breakaways during the Tour de France, and may even pick up the occasional win at the lower Continental level. Of the further additions — Jonas Koch, Baptiste Planckaert, Lorenzo Rota, Taco van der Hoorn, Riccardo Minali and Georg Zimmermann — it is the Dutchman Van der Hoorn that catches the eye most. The former Jumbo-Visma rider may have a short  with just the lesser known Schaal Sels one-day race on his list of wins, alongside the Primus Classic and a BinckBank Tour stage, but may be a source of victories for his new team. Taking just four wins in 2020, none of which were at WorldTour level, was not exactly inspiring stuff for the team. In fact, the biggest victory came from Xandro Meurisse who won a stage at the Vuelta a Murcia before he clinched the overall in the two-day race. Sadly, the Belgian all-rounder joined Alpecin-Fenix over the winter and so will not be repeating similar performances for Intermarché-Wanty-Gobert Matériaux in 2021. Meintjes may have struggled since finishing eighth at the 2017 Tour, but the 28-year-old has an opportunity here to save his floundering career. Equally, having signed the South African climber on a one-year deal the team may have landed themselves an absolute steal. Israel

 Tel Aviv-based non-profit organisation Having finished bottom of the WorldTour pile in 2020, one imagines that when Israel Start-up Nation owner Sylvan Adams delivered his end-of-year report, the Canadian billionaire property developer will have insisted that in 2021, his riders and support staff 'must do better'. The capture of seven-time grand tour winner Chris Froome from Ineos Grenadiers that sparked a massive recruitment drive took the headlines, but the pressure will be on the 35-year-old who has not won a race since May 2018 to deliver the goods. The overall strengthening of the squad, however, should enable the team to make the required improvements. The arrivals of Sebastian Berwick, Patrick Bevin, Alessandro De Marchi, Carl Fredrik Hagen, Daryl Impey, Taj Jones, Sep Vanmarcke and Michael Woods will both offer support to Froome, while simultaneously add to the team's collective  A highly creditable eighth place at the 2019 Vuelta a España — between Wilco Kelderman and Marc Soler — highlights why Fredrik Hagen was wanted to help Froome in the mountains, while De Marchi ( ), Impey ( ), and Woods ( ) have all proved themselves at the highest level. Out of contract at the end of the season and expecting his first child, Alex Dowsett managed to get into the breakaway during stage eight at the Giro d'Italia. For some that may have been enough. Not Dowsett, not on this day. Having worked with team-mate Matthias Brändle, Dowsett escaped around 20km from the line before using his time trial skills to perfection and claim an emotional win for both rider and fans watching at home. He is the big-budget signing around which the team's Tour ambitions have been built, but can Froome buck the trend for youngsters winning and take home a record-equalling fifth  ? Whatever happens, following the Froome roadshow should be utterly engrossing. Holland

 Business software provider and supermarket chain In 2015 the Dutch team won just two WorldTour races — stages at the Eneco Tour and Vuelta a España. Five years later two monuments (Milan-Sanremo and Liège-Bastogne-Liège), a grand tour (Vuelta a España) and three stages at the Tour de France resulted in them becoming the No 1 ranked team in men's road cycling. It has been quite the transformation. May have lost a few  , but the arrivals of Edoardo Affini, Sam Oomen, Nathan Van Hooydonck should provide ample replacement. Are widely expected to be challenging for the Tour de France again following a heartbreaking denouement to last year's race when leader Primoz Roglic lost his yellow jersey to Tadej Pogacar on the penultimate day. Are fully expected, too, to be targeting the cobbled classics with Wout van Aert poised to resume hostilities with his cyclo-cross nemesis Mathieu van der Poel in what is turning into one of the great rivalries of the sport. Elsewhere, will be fascinating to follow the development of Tobias Foss, the 2019 Tour de l'Avenir winner, and track the trajectory of Sepp Kuss, the increasingly impressive mountain  A fortnight after enduring the crushing disappointment of losing the leader's yellow jersey at the Tour, Roglic bounced back in the best way imaginable.

 Belgian national lottery and adhesives manufacturer Bolstered largely by Caleb Ewan's wins — the sprinter won two Tour de France stages, following two at the Tour Down Under and one apiece at the UAE Tour and the Tour de Wallonie before taking a magnificent seventh of the season at Scheldeprijs — only Matthew Holmes and Tim Wellens managed to take home any WorldTour wins in 2020. Whether or not it was fuelled by suffering their worst season in a decade, or not, an influx of young riders — all but one (Kamil Malecki, 25) are either 23 or under — gives the team a very new feel for 2021. It may also lead to them challenging for fewer races too, at least in the short-term. May need some of the older heads like Philippe Gilbert and John Degenkolb to step up during the spring classics, while Tim Wellens' form at Etoile de Bessèges, where he won a stage and the overall, would suggest the Belgian is in fine form in the countdown to the WorldTour. Although there were two stage wins at the Tour for Ewan along with two for Wellens at the Vuelta a España, it was an early-season victory from Holmes that stood out most. The Briton, competing in his first WorldTour race after joining from Madison-Genesis, did the improbable and ended Richie Porte's six-year reign on the Willunga Hill stage at the Tour Down Under. Holmes later impressed in breakaways at the Giro d'Italia. Having made wholesale changes, including bringing in five riders from their under-23 squad, the departure of Carl Fredrik Hagen to Israel Start-up Nation will likely cost them in the hillier stages. Appears, though, that Lotto-Soudal's plans are focused very much on the long-term. Spain

 Spanish mobile telephone company Given they lost Richard Carapaz, Mikel Landa and Nairo Quintana going into the year, and signed no fewer than 14 riders, last season was always going to be one of transition. Nobody, however, will have predicted that the oldest team in the WorldTour would have endured the worst year in their long and illustrious history since first forming as Reynolds in 1980. It is safe to say that for Movistar in 2021, things can only get better. While the once reliable Alejando Valverde, who at 40 is the oldest rider in the WorldTour, is starting to look his age, big things will be expected from Marc Soler. Enric Mas, meanwhile, will be hoping to build on his quietly impressive performances at last year's tours of France and Spain where he finished fifth, despite barely poking his nose into the wind. Big things, too, are expected from marquee signing Miguel Ángel López who arrives from Astana and will, presumably, form part of the team's two-pronged attack at the Tour de France alongside his new team-mate Mas. Although not widely heralded, the captures of Iván García Cortina and Gregor Mühlberger should give the squad an outlet in the spring classics, while also providing a couple of proven engines in the grand tours. Gonzalo Serrano arrives from Caja Rural-Seguros RGA while Abner González became the first Puerto Rican to ride in the WorldTour. It was an uncharacteristically poor season for Movistar who managed just two wins in the entire season, both coming from Soler. Having first won a stage at the Mallorca Challenge in February, the Spaniard landed a superb stage at the Vuelta a España after attacking on the descent off the final climb on stage two before soloing to victory. It came as a huge relief for the team, with the added bonus of the win being on their home roads. A year after a very public dispute at the Vuelta, ​Ángel López has joined the team he said was full of ""stupid people"". One imagines the pre-season training camp will have been interesting. Either way, Movistar have acquired a talented climber and proven stage winner. South Africa

 South African charity and Swiss cycling apparel Having lost their title sponsor late in 2020, Doug Ryder's squad was handed a reprieve from Swiss apparel brand Assos who already supplied the team with their kit. Though welcome, the deal came through too late to halt a mass exodus with the squad losing 15 riders to other teams while four retired. Coming in the other direction were 17 riders of varying experience from the under-23, Continental and WorldTour divisions. Despite the uncertainty surrounding the team, kept hold of world hour record holder Victor Campenaerts, while the veteran climber Domenico Pozzovivo, now 38, has one year left on his contract. Giacomo Nizzolo will be hoping to regain the form he had before crashing out of last year's Tour de France just days after winning the European road title in Plouay. May rue the departure of Ben O'Connor to Ag2r-Citroën, but will be hoping the experience of new signings like Simon Clarke and Sergio Henao can help guide their new-look squad in the right direction. While there were some impressive wins for Italian sprinter Nizzolo, it was O'Connor's stage victory at the Giro that towered above the rest. A day after losing out to Jan Tratnik, the Australian who was out of contract at the end of the season, bounced back in the best possible way to land the biggest win of his career. Possibly a big mistake in not re-signing him. He may not have claimed a single race since the 2017 Tour when he won on La Planche des Belles Filles, but Fabio Aru may just be able to rebuild his career with Qhubeka-Assos. The 30-year-old has one year in which to do so as he enters what many are calling the last-chance saloon.

 US bicycle manufacturer and Italian coffee brand It was a mixed season for the team whose main general classification rider Vincenzo Nibali looked his age (36) at the Giro d'Italia, while another, Bauke Mollema, crashed out of the Tour de France with a broken wrist. It was not all doom and gloom, however. Richie Porte finished third at the Tour — the best result of his career — and world champion Mads Pedersen managed to show off the rainbow stripes in Paris. The early-season win from Jasper Stuyven at Omloop Het Nieuwsblad was hugely impressive, while wins from Pedersen at the Tour of Poland, BinckBank Tour and Ghent-Wevelgem along with the return to the fold of Quinn Simmons — who was suspended after the 2019  junior world champion posted “divisive” and “incendiary” tweets — would suggest that it is the one-day classics where the squad's strengths may lie in 2021. Though not in the WorldTour, Matteo Moschetti twice got the better of Pascal Ackermann with wins at the Mallorca Challenge, leading to many saying the 24-year-old can challenge in the big sprints. Very quiet in the transfer market, signing just Amanuel Ghebreigzabhier from the WorldTour while three under-23 riders —  Jakob Egholm, Mattias Skjelmose Jensen, Antonio Tiberi — also joined the squad. Having book-ended his maiden Tour with two second place finishes, Pedersen did what few had predicted and got the better of Mathieu van der Poel and Wout van Aert at Ghent-Wevelgem. Benefiting from the pair's refusal to commit in the finale, the young Dane proved yet again he was both a supremely talented and canny rider as he won his first semi-classic after outsprinting Florian Sénéchal and Matteo Trentin to the line. Having finally made the podium at a grand tour at last year's Tour, the 36-year-old Richie Porte will ride for his former paymasters Ineos Grenadiers in 2021. The departure of the solid professional — though not a seasoned winner in the big races — may be a big loss in the grand tours. UAE

 Emirates The Emirati-owned squad with the Italian heart enjoyed its greatest season yet in terms of both number of wins and, perhaps more importantly, the quality of wins. Stages in all three grand tours, along with the biggest prize of them all — the fabled yellow jersey for winning the Tour de France — propelled the squad into whole new stratosphere. Along with Ineos Grenadiers and Jumbo-Visma, UAE Team Emirates are now expected to challenge for the biggest honours in world cycling. The arrival of Rafal Majka should give Tadej Pogacar more support when he needs it most — the young Slovenian cannot expect to defend his Tour title without having to do some of the heavy lifting in 2021 — while Matteo Trentin will bring some much-needed experience. The surprise signing of Marc Hirschi, meanwhile, will both take the pressure off Pogacar while also, on paper, assuring his new paymasters some big wins. Was a big surprise to see young Belgian sprinter Jasper Philipsen leave for Alpecin-Fenix, but armed with Fernando Gaviria and the evergreen Alexander Kristoff should have enough to challenge in the sprints and one-day classics. Another one to watch will be Brandon McNulty, 22, who finished 15th on his grand tour debut at last year's Giro d'Italia. Pogacar's performance in the penultimate day time trial of the Tour was one of the most astonishing days in the history of the world's biggest bike race. For Pogacar, his performance was career-defining; for his rival and compatriot Primoz Roglic heartbreaking. A day after winning on La Planche des Belles Filles, Pogacar became the second youngest winner in the Tour's history dating back to 1903. Put simply: it was unbelievable. Hirschi's arrival from Sunweb was not only the biggest transfer of UAE Team Emirates' close season, but of the entire WorldTour also. Indeed, it was reported by  that his new employers multiplied his salary by 14 — from around €70,000 to €1 million. But can he deliver? Probably."

Local golfers miss out on first day back on course - but cross-border rules row finally resolved

Thanks to the Telegraph's efforts, scores of Llanymynech Golf Club members living over the border in England will now be able to tee off

29 March 2021 • 9:21pm
","The bizarre, and, at times, bitter, “Llanymynech Lock-out” concluded in blessed peace on Monday night when the Welsh Government finally permitted the English members to resume playing on the borders course. As England’s fairways on Monday re-opened following the latest three-month ban,  , despite some of them living just 50 yards from the entrance.   revealed on Sunday that the home course of Ian Woosnam, the former Masters champion, was up in arms after being told by Powys Count Council on the weekend that Lllanymech GC could still be played by Welsh residents but not, legally, by their English counterparts. Restrictions imposed by the Welsh Government currently preclude English residents from crossing the border. Three of the holes are in England, with the rest in Wales and even though the entrance is actually on the St George side of Offa’s Dyke, Powys CC felt unable to give official approval due to the guidelines. “The Welsh members were given permission to cross into England when the Wales Government allowed them to start replaying a few weeks ago,” Stuart Jones, the club’s chairman, said. “But now the Prime Minister has said England can resume, that permission is not being given the other way around. How is that not discrimination?” The club desperately sought a solution, with appeals direct to the Welsh Government and First Minister, Mark Drakeford. However, these went ignored until the   story appeared. On Monday afternoon, a statement sent to the   from the Welsh Government’s press office appeared to have given the green light. “It would be reasonable for members of Llanymynech Golf Club to enter or leave Wales within the confines of the golf course,” it read.  However, Jones was still waiting for clearance from the council. Powys CC told Jones it was only there to enforce the law and would only act if there was a complaint. But with enmity running high between certain of the respective Welsh and English memberships there were fears that a complaint would arise.  In January, police visited the club when golf was locked down in Wales despite it still being allowed at the time under England's guidelines. Llanymynech pays its fees to Powys CC, but is governed by England Golf. After the January episode, Jones was understandably wary and went back to the council  on Monday afternoon, for official assurance. “They say they are working with their legal team to try and facilitate a way around the guidance but they cannot promise anything,” Jones said. “Eventually, as the last golfers on the course finished their rounds, Jones received the assurances he and his committee felt were required. “Steffan Roberts, the deputy director of culture and sport for the Welsh Government, has called me and apologised for the misunderstanding and said that ALL Llanymynech members both English and Welsh can cross the border as a reasonable excuse to access the course and play golf,” Jones said. “I haven't received the written confirmation which I requested, but I have notified the members anyway. They deserve to know and putting out of their misery - they can't renege on this. We are grateful to the Telegraph for highlighting this issue and  hopefully we can put this ridiculous chapter behind us and start to enjoy our unique course once again.” The English membership - which forms more than two-thirds of the club - has lost a day, but will be delighted to discover that from Tuesday morning they are free to re-indulge in their passion. There will be relief in the club as whole. The committee had been divided on whether or not to open and tensions were escalating."

Eddie Jones’ England have been here before – and this is how he turned it around in 2018
","
In 2018, England finished fifth in the Six Nations, their joint-worst finish alongside 2021 - 18 months later they were in a World Cup final

","Eddie Jones has seen this film before, and while the uninspiring plot might have tormented and tortured, the ending was not half bad. England's   - mirroring their 2021 campaign - was a record low but 18 months later they came within one match of conquering the world for a second time.  That 2018 championship, where England's only victories came against Wales at home and Italy away, ended with Eddie Jones' side in a spiraling freefall. A home loss to Ireland on the final day - England's first at Twickenham in the Six Nations since 2012 - gifted Joe Schmidt's side the Grand Slam, Triple Crown and the championship, and the Irish defeat also put the nail into the coffin of Dylan Hartley's captaincy.  Mick Cleary wrote for  that ""Eddie Jones had gone from messiah to the man with his finger in the dyke as the water comes pouring through"". Two years beforehand, lest we forget, England were winning a Grand Slam themselves, while a year later in 2017 they won the championship, too. Fast forward three years to 2021 and the trumpeter is playing a familiar tune. England equalled that 2018 nadir with a fifth-place Six Nations finish - a year after winning the tournament but failing with a Slam bid too - but the similarities do not stop there. Both crusades, in 2018 and 2021, were blighted by breakdown issues, captaincy queries and accusations of selection ignorance towards the England head coach. There was a defining summer tour against South Africa looming in 2018, too, and this year's summer schedule, in whatever guise it takes, is already shaping up to be of equal importance - even if England's Lions will be missing. Crucially, Jones did turn things around in 2018. This time around he might have an extra year to plug the leak - the World Cup in France is still two years away, whereas in 2018 rugby's showpiece came just a year later - but Jones' actions and motives following that 2018 Six Nations disappointment might help us to predict his next few moves in 2021 -  . England's breakdown inefficiency became the biggest talking point of their 2018 Six Nations. Tom Curry had not yet emerged as one of Jones' leading lights and fellow flanker Sam Underhill was only deemed as good enough for the bench. With Courtney Lawes at blindside and Chris Robshaw at openside - and   - England toiled on the floor, with the Calcutta Cup loss against Scotland - featuring 'that' pass from Finn Russell - best embodying their breakdown malaise. Nearly two-thirds of England's penalties were conceded at the breakdown in that 2018 tournament. There are parallels with 2021 here, too. Once again without Underhill, and also without two of Europe's best breakdown forwards - the Wasps duo of Jack Willis and Joe Launchbury - England had the worst ruck efficiency of any team in this year's Six Nations. And it gets worse. In the 2021 championship England had the worst average ruck speed (of available data), worst ruck efficiency, worst tackle success percentage, and won the fewest turnovers of Jones's tenure. They also conceded the second-most turnovers of the Australia's stewardship. All of which were worse than 2018. The try-scoring and points conceded tallies are record lows, too. Whoever and wherever England play this summer, expect a renewed emphasis towards their travails on the floor. Dylan Hartley's injury midway through the 2018 tournament forced Jones to look elsewhere for his captain. There were numerous suitable candidates, George Ford, Maro Itoje or, even, Chris Robshaw, but Owen Farrell was always the favourite. The Saracens playmaker deputised for the crocked Hartley midway through the 2018 Six Nations and, despite returning as captain for the final-round loss to Ireland, Hartley never regained a convincing grip on the captaincy. Farrell led England to a promising if ultimately disappointing 2-1 series loss in South Africa, as Hartley was deemed ""unavailable"" for the tour. For the 2018 autumn internationals, the last time Hartley wore an England shirt, he and Farrell were ""co-captains"" but there was more than a sense that the hooker's time was up. Hartley's rival for the No 2 shirt, Jamie George, had made the starting spot his own, with Hartley forced to co-captain from the bench in England's final Test of the year, a convincing win against Australia at Twickenham. What does all that mean for Farrell in 2021? Unlike Hartley, Farrell is in a more advantageous position: the end of his international career is not in sight, he led England to a World Cup final, and there seems to be a dearth of candidates putting pressure on to replace him.  mean he is not an obvious alternative, while Jones' reluctance to settle on Ford as his first-choice fly-half - he was on the bench against Scotland at the beginning of the tournament - means the Leicester playmaker cannot be seriously considered.   is a natural leader, and is a definite in the starting XV, but he has never even captained his club, Sale, let alone his country. Farrell's likely inclusion in the Lions squad for the summer, however, will at least give Jones the opportunity to look at other options. Could Farrell's unavailability for England do for him (as captain) like it did for Hartley? It is unlikely, but Farrell should know from past experience that historic positives like the 2019 World Cup count for little on Jones' captaincy list of requirements. Hartley led England to back-to-back Six Nations titles in 2016 and 2017 - a Grand Slam in the former - but his international career, not just captaincy, was dead and buried by the end of 2018. After the 2018 disappointment, Eddie Jones knew fresh impetus was required to rejuvenate England's attack. Enter Scott Wisemantel. The Australian looked after England's offensive play for the 2018 summer tour to South Africa, and the revolution was such that his contract was extended to include the 2019 World Cup. Several of England's senior players have spoken on the record about how highly they regard Wisemantel's coaching, both on an individual and collective level. Wisemantel returned to his native Australia after the 2019 World Cup, and has since taken on a coaching consultancy role with Dave Rennie's Wallabies. Former England sevens player and coach Simon Amor took over the attacking reins after Wisemantel's departure, but it would not be remiss to say that England have not set the rugby world alight with the ball since Amor's arrival. Despite winning two trophies in 2020, England's strategic and tactical approach came under fire from pundits and fans alike and, this year, despite improvements against France and, at times, Wales, the wolves are still at England's attacking door. The difference in 2021 compared with 2018 is that, three years ago, it was Jones himself who was in control of England's attack. When that did not work, Jones wasted no time in bringing in his compatriot, Wisemantel. With Amor's relative experience as an international XVs coach, there could be an argument for bringing in a more experienced head alongside him for England's fixtures this summer. The more drastic approach, of course, would be to dispense of Amor's services entirely and find a totally fresh replacement. The maelstrom of selection, with its subjectivity and media and fan pressure, is where Jones was arguably at his most radical in 2018 and, considering  , there is a double irony at play which requires attention, too. Exeter's No 8 has not been on the pitch for England since the 2018 Six Nations. In that championship, with Simmonds already playing a central role, there was similar clamour for a different Exeter back-row forward, Don Armand. Jones sort of caved in to public demand, then - Armand was included on the bench for that final-round loss against Ireland - but he has quite notoriously resisted the urge in 2021. On the back of that 2018 Six Nations disappointment, however, Jones did acknowledge that the British public's desire for a revolution was justified. Almost half (17 of the 35 original names) of that 2018 Six Nations squad did not tour South Africa in the summer, but the squad that faced the Springboks formed the spine of the squad that reached the World Cup final a year later. Twenty of the 32 players that featured in the 2019 World Cup for England toured South Africa in 2018 – and eight more of the World Cup 32 were injured or unavailable to travel to Africa. Jones also picked on form for that tour, too - 56 per cent of the touring party came from the Premiership semi-finalists in 2018: Saracens, Exeter, Wasps, and Newcastle. Today, we are two years out from a World Cup, when in 2018 we were just one, but this summer's tour does have a defining vibe about it, as South Africa did in 2018. Delving deeper into that 2018 Six Nations squad, however, and there are further parallels. Both flanker Gary Graham and centre Cameron Redpath were called up to England's squad for the tournament; both went on to become Scotland internationals,   in that Calcutta Cup loss this year.  The comparisons to be made with   are alarming. The Wasps wing is still uncapped despite his presence in England's squad for the entirety of the 2021 Six Nations, yet Italy have publicly declared their interest in the speedster. Odogwu does qualify for the Azzurri and, after being largely ignored by Jones, there is still a chance for him to be another that slipped through the English talent net. Even if Jones could never totally put his faith in a back-up   in 2018 - he picked Danny Cipriani as a third fly-half for the South Africa tour - the Australian at least entertained the notion. Marcus Smith was named as an 18-year-old apprentice in that 2018 squad, too; he remains uncapped. Jones also got rid of those he perceived to be dead wood. Stalwarts Danny Care and Chris Robshaw played every match of the 2018 Six Nations, starting regularly. The latter went on tour to South Africa but never featured for England again, while the former did not tour against the Springboks and has not played for England since the 2018 autumn internationals. Vociferous flanker James Haskell did not play for England again after the 2018 Six Nations, either. And Richard Wigglesworth did not tour South Africa and managed just two more matches in a white shirt, in the 2018 autumn internationals, despite Saracens' success. Nearly half (42 per cent) of the players involved in the wider England squad for the 2018 Six Nations have not played for England since 2018. Mike Brown, whose tenacity established him as a favourite of Jones, has not featured since that South Africa tour. The Watson-May-Daly triumvirate was born and, rightly or wrongly, is still going strong now. Only 23 per cent of those who toured South Africa have not been seen in a white jersey since 2018. Jones clearly still places a lot of importance on partnerships and systems that were conceived in 2018 and were carried through to the World Cup in 2019 and beyond. But his actions between the 2018 Six Nations and the summer tour were ruthless and radical; don't bet against him behaving similarly this year - if he gets the chance."

Sergio Aguero to leave Manchester City at end of season - with Erling Haaland incoming? 
","
Pep Guardiola held a private meeting with Aguero to tell him the club would not be renewing their all-time leading scorer's contract
","James Ducker, ","
29 March 2021 • 8:22pm
","Manchester City have commissioned a statue in honour of Sergio Aguero after it was announced on Monday night that the Argentina striker - arguably the greatest player in their history - will leave club at the end of the season. Aguero cemented a place in City folklore when he secured the club’s first Premier League title with a dramatic stoppage time winner on the final day of his first season in England to snatch the championship away from bitter rivals Manchester United on goal difference. It would prove the most unforgettable moment of a decade long love affair with City, during which time he became the club’s all time top scorer with an extraordinary 257 goals in just 384 appearances and one of the Premier League’s best loved and most revered imports. Aguero’s future had become the subject of intense debate after an injury plagued past year and it has now been confirmed the 32-year-old will depart when his contract expires this summer. Pep Guardiola held a private meeting with Aguero after training late Monday afternoon when the manager delivered the news that the club would not be offering him a new contract. Aguero then received an emotional phone call from Khaldoon al-Mubarak, the City chairman, who lauded the player’s glittering contribution to the club following his £38 million move from Atletico Madrid in 2011 and revealed the news that they plan to erect a statue at the Etihad Stadium in his honour. City are eager to sign Erling Haaland, the prolific Borussia Dortmund and Norway striker, as Aguero’s long-time successor, even if the club face competition from Real Madrid, Chelsea and Manchester United for the player’s signature and would have to shatter their £65m transfer record to sign him. Barcelona are one of the clubs eager to sign Aguero and a move to the Nou Camp would raise the prospect of the Argentine teaming up with his compatriot and close friend, Lionel Messi. Messi is also out of contract this summer and has been linked with a move to City but new Barcelona president Joan Laporta has pledged to keep the player at the Catalan club. Aggrieved by Barcelona’s decision to sell Luis Suarez to Atletico Madrid last summer, Messi could consider Aguero to be the ideal replacement for the Uruguayan, although Aguero - who has talked about finishing his career in his native Argentina - is likely to have a number of offers to weigh up. A winner of four Premier League titles, one FA Cup and five League Cups, Aguero hopes his final two months at City will be marked by more silverware as the club chase an unprecedented quadruple, including the only leading trophy still to elude the striker - the Champions League. It could prove an emotional swansong, even if supporters could be denied the chance to bid farewell to Aguero in person unless fans are allowed back into the Etihad before the end of the season. Having undergone a knee operation last June, Aguero has endured a troubled road back to fitness, with complications following surgery, other injury problems and coronavirus related problems all combining to limit him to just four league starts this term and only five in all competitions. As well as smashing Eric Brook’s 78-year record to become City’s all-time record goalscorer when he found the net in a 4-2 Champions League win over Napoli in 2017, Aguero is the highest scoring overseas player in Premier League history and also boasts the competition’s best goals per minute ratio. In January last year, he overtook Alan Shearer for the   after plundered his 12th in a game away to Aston Villa. Yet Aguero will always be best remembered - and forever synonymous - with his last gasp goal to clinch a dramatic 3-2 win over Queens Park Rangers on the final day of the 2011/12 season just when it looked like City had blown the title and handed it to rivals United, whose dominance Aguero played a huge part in ending. City have already commissioned statues of Aguero’s former team-mates, David Silva and Vincent Kompany, and work will now begin on one to immortalise Aguero. City also intend to install a permanent mosaic in honour of Aguero at the club’s training base and will begin work on plans to mark his departure in the final home league game of the season against Everton when it is hoped that some supporters will permitted entry to the Etihad to bid a fond farewell to an icon and hero. “Sergio’s contribution to Manchester City over the last 10 years cannot be overstated,” Al-Mubarak said. “His legend will be indelibly etched into the memories of everyone who loves the Club and maybe even in those who simply love football. “This is not yet the moment for farewell words and speeches. There is still much to achieve in the remainder of the time we have with Sergio, and we look forward to his contributions to the challenges which lay ahead. “In the meantime, it gives me great pleasure to announce that we will be commissioning an artist to create a statue of Sergio to live at the Etihad Stadium alongside the ones under construction for Vincent and David. And we look forward to the opportunity to bid Sergio a fitting farewell at the end of the season.”"

Jimmy White: 'I gave Stephen Hendry a head start of 10g of cocaine and four bottles of whisky'
","
White renews rivalries with Hendry in first round of qualifying for World Championship in April
",Hector Nunns,"
26 March 2021 • 1:12pm
","For Jimmy White, a renewal of rivalries with Stephen Hendry is enough to unleash a flood of memories - but few of them are happy ones.  Both men might now be in their fifties and well past their prime -   - but their reunion in the first round of qualifying for the Betfred World Championship in April promises to be one of snooker's red-letter occasions.  For White, however, the draw was bittersweet. In four World Championship finals between 1990 and 1994, White was beaten by Hendry: all left scars, although the deepest wounds were inflicted in 1992, when he lost despite being 14-8 ahead, and then 18-17 two years later.  While Hendry clocked up a record seven titles in total, White never did win a world final, although he was crowned the 'People's Champion', with public sympathy cranking up after each apparently impossible defeat.  White's free-spirited playing style was an endearing contrast to  , but the fact he was just as much a 'Whirlwind' in his private life ultimately proved decisive in denying him a title.  In his own autobiography White, now 58, claimed “I am lucky to be alive…I know drugs probably cost me 10 world titles”.  Speaking after the draw against Hendry, he said: “I have beaten Stephen in the World Championship a couple of times, but unfortunately they aren’t the ones everyone talks about.  “I lost the four finals to him…but in those [early 1990s] days I was giving him a head start of about 10 grams of cocaine and four bottles of Jack Daniels. “I came very close in winning two of the finals against him. In 1992 I was 14-8 up and getting my winning speech ready, but lost the next 10 frames.  “And then in 1994 I twitched a black in the decider at 17-17. But it is what it is, and I might not have been here if I had won the World Championship the way I was.”  White and Hendry's rivalry was always a friendly one - the Scot had practised with White, six years his senior, when he was just 13, and left an indelible impression even then. “I knew he was something special straight away and he became one of the greatest players the game has seen,” White added. “I played the majority of my best years against legends, two of the best ever in Steve Davis and Stephen. Steve was a bit more conservative at the table.   “And then there was this fantastic potter Stephen that came along and I had to compete against both. We have had so many battles not only at the World Championship but throughout our careers. And to draw each other at this stage of our careers is very bizarre.”  Either player would need to win four matches to get back to the Crucible. Hendry’s last appearance was in 2012, while White has not got to Sheffield since 2006, but the Londoner’s head is still spinning that fate has taken a hand, and given him a chance of some revenge so late in his career.  “I didn’t even see the draw announced on TV this week, or see it in any email,”  he said. “I had just finished practising, turned my phone on and I saw that I had two missed calls from Stephen.  “That on its own wasn’t too strange because we had been practising together recently. But I started thinking he wouldn’t call me twice so quickly like that to arrange a session.  “So I started to suspect what might have happened. I called him back, he said ‘Can you believe that’, and then I knew.  “It is absolutely bizarre, something from the snooker gods for sure. It is one that a lot of people might enjoy and look forward to.  “My closing line to him was that we wouldn’t be having a practice together before that match. But for me, I have found a bit of form and whoever I played, that is what I would be taking into it.  “I know that I will be playing him Tuesday week, and it is all about being ready for that. I haven’t stopped practising for about two or three years now. I'm much more disciplined than I used to be.” "

Best friend of Jeremy Wisten: 'Offer released youngsters the same care as Army veterans'
","
Special report: How former Man City youth player's death, aged 18, shone a light on difficulties endured by released Academy players 
",Mike McGrath,"
30 March 2021 • 7:00am
","Football clubs must allocate more money to look after youngsters they release and should offer a level of care similar to those Army veterans, according to the mental-health support group backed by Jeremy Wisten’s best friend.  Wisten, 18, took his own life last year , with his family telling the   he was their “brightest star”. Go Again, who are supported by Wisten’s best friend Tyrhys Dolan, have highlighted the problems facing players after release and have treated some cases 10 years on from leaving football.  Research by the Professional Footballers’ Association shows that only one in six players signed at the age of 16 remain in the game by the time they are 21, and the support group has called for clubs to allocate more money to help the hundreds of youngsters who are released each year.  “When they come out of an academy after such a long time it is such a shock to the system. It feels like everything to their identity,” said Robert Broomhead, founder of Go Again. “It is devastating for them, it feels like everything at the time.  “We work with people in the NHS helping Army veterans and there needs to be some similar structure for people transitioning in football. The veteran services put a lot of time re-engaging people with responsibility around managing their own time and their own finances and building their CVs, dealing with those moments of boredom where you have that craving to have the adrenaline rush.  ""Anyone who has been through any trauma, it doesn’t spill over until later down the line. Sometimes it is 10 years down the line when it all spills out. By the time we were talking to people they were already in hospital or had significant mental-health issues.  “Without that people search for things to fill the gap which is often maladaptive, sometimes gambling or alcohol. Coming out of the Army, or football, or retiring from other industries, you see so often it is a vulnerable time for people’s mental health. It is about normalising that, that it is a difficult process but there is a future.” The PFA are aware of the need for increased data around released players and are undertaking a survey to ask members how they would want access to mental-health support.  Those released from Premier League clubs are offered a two-day residential course at Loughborough University to show them opportunities outside and within football, and are kept on a database for “three-to-five years post scholarship” to monitor well-being.  Clubs are establishing Academy alumni lists and City themselves have gone beyond the standard protocols to check on their former players, making contact once a month, setting up trials and putting together highlights reels.   But Broomhead, whose consultancy is working with three EFL clubs, has found it is difficult for players to engage with the Academies who have released them during checks.  “Quite often the people trying to call players who had been released, there was understandably a barrier there because players would often not want to speak to people who had released them,” he said. “The intentions are good but I think this area could be more of a priority and the funds that are there could be prioritised for this. I think there could be a rethink of this being a massive part of an Academy’s corporate responsibility.  “They may not be at the club or an immediate priority but I think it would help recruiting players and for parents. They let so many players go that it is an important part.” Wisten’s death has brought into sharp focus the sacrifices young players make to become professional footballers, with the inquest into the teenager’s death opened last November and a date for the hearing yet to be announced.  Those closest to Jeremy Wisten talk about the person away from football. He had just submitted his university application and enjoyed the same things as most teenagers. Concerts, parties, hanging out with friends.  “He was our brightest star, he loved life and loved his family and friends,” his father Manila told the    It is five months since Wisten’s death and while he was like other 18-year-olds in many ways, he had also dedicated a large part of his life to being a professional footballer at Manchester City’s Academy.  Coroner Zak Golombeck read glowing tributes to Wisten as an “incredible talent”, who had been on City’s books since playing for the Under-13s, with the dream of making it as a Premier League player and following in the footsteps of Vincent Kompany.  When he was released in 2019 after struggling to return from injuries, Wisten joined a group of young men in limbo. Hundreds find themselves in that position every year, so close to realising their dreams but unattached to a club.   The Professional Footballers’ Association union estimate that 500 to 600 are scholars at clubs each year, undertaking a two-year programme of full-time football and education. “If we were a university we’d be struck off, because about one in six are still in the game at the age of 21 after being signed at 16,” said PFA chief executive Gordon Taylor.  Those in the system face a conundrum as very few become professionals. There is educational support from clubs and the PFA to look at Plan B, but the perception of football is that only those totally dedicated to the sport will make it to the top of the game.  The majority of scholars take a BTEC in Sporting Excellence and there is a high pass-rate among footballers, although taking A-Levels is not straightforward because of timetabling of classes and club training schedules. Being at Manchester City, Wisten attended St Bede’s and received a private-school education.   Many young players at Premier League clubs go to the most prestigious schools in their area, giving them a platform for success off the pitch. But there is still a pressure to succeed at a sport they have committed so much of their lives to.    “The pressure is constant and they have not just turned up at 16, they have been doing it for 10 years before that,” said Michael Bennett, PFA director of player welfare. “Imagine the emotional rollercoaster of trying to get a contract every two years throughout that journey. They have exams at the same time, they are trying to get a contract and they are also trying to turn into young people.”    Even with qualifications, it is still a life-changing event when a player is told he is no longer needed by his club. Theo Richardson left Manchester United in 2018 and went part-time while setting up a business as a personal trainer. When with the first team he would be saving shots from United’s global stars, then suddenly found himself playing non-league football.  “The toughest thing was saying to people that I’d gone from playing with Zlatan Ibrahimovic and Paul Pogba to playing against Warrington on a Tuesday night,” he said. “That is the thing boys cannot handle. When your friends ask ‘who are you playing for?’ that is a massive kick in the teeth, especially when you’ve come from where you have.  “At Manchester United, that club is all they know. When they get told they have nothing at the end of it, a lot of them crumble. “I remember them saying ‘you won’t need to send clips out’. People think because you’ve been where you have, you’ll easily find another club. I went through a total of 18 clubs in that period of playing non-league and sorting out my Plan B.”  Richardson always had an eye on life after football, having suffered rejections earlier in his career. But for many, they have only known Academy life.  From having nutritional meals provided and a player liaison officer on call, suddenly players who have been released are in the real world.  There is plenty of help available, not least from former coaches offering advice and details of trials at other clubs. Richardson says Manchester United were always on the end of a phone and he now goes into their Academy to talk to young players about not making it as a pro.  The Premier League have a “robust database” of players they track for three to five years after they leave academies. The PFA monitors those slightly older. But all phone calls require the person on the end to engage.  “Quite often with the people trying to call players who had been released, there was understandably a barrier there because players would often not want to speak to people who had released them,” said Robert Broomhead, founder of Go Again.  Players can find themselves without a club yet believing they could still have a future in the game, which is where Shane Birtles, education advisor at the PFA, found himself after serving an apprenticeship at Huddersfield Town.  “The apprenticeship gives a lot of options but if you still feel you are good enough to be a professional footballer, that is when it can take a little bit more time to adjust,” Birtles said. “You may not be ready to explore other careers even though support is available and the PFA visit on a regular basis. If they want to get back into football, that is all they are thinking about at that moment in time.” After Wisten died last October, Mason Greenwood dedicated his goal against RB Leipzig in the Champions League to him. “That one was for you bro,” he wrote on his social media platforms. Two teenagers growing up in Manchester trying to be professionals, and giving everything they could to make it.  "

Exclusive: TV giant Discovery wants Ashes rights as part of 'Netflix for sport' streaming plans
","
The US television group has joined a three-way race for UK rights - although Amazon has ruled itself out of the running
","Tom Morgan, ","
29 March 2021 • 9:00pm
","Discovery, the American TV giant, is a surprise contender to screen this winter’s Ashes as part of attempts to revolutionise sports coverage on its Netflix-style streaming platform.  understands the broadcaster is in a three-horse race with BT and Sky for a potential £50 million-plus four-year package to show England matches in Australia. Amazon has, however, ruled itself out a deal which covers both the men’s and women’s Ashes, the men’s white-ball tour in 2022 and the Big Bash League franchise. At least three serious offers have been tabled to Cricket Australia for a UK rights package that, some analysts say, represents potentially better value than the billion pound-plus deals that are struck for Premier League football. With no plans to join an “overheated” domestic football bidding war due to begin this spring, Discovery,  understands, sees the Ashes as an opportunity to build on a new customer base established during Tokyo 2020. The US television group believes its Discovery+ service will rival Disney, Apple and Netflix in size, having been launched in January in the United States and in some parts of Europe, as viewers turn away from network television. Cricket Australia circulated tender documents last month for its four-year UK package, which is held by BT Sport and includes Australia’s other home internationals and the Big Bash League. Sources said the previous term, of five years, was purchased for in excess of £80 million, but there has since been a downward trend in the sports rights market. Like football, cricket has tried to tempt new platforms, and interest from Discovery is seen as a major boost after Amazon ruled out any offer. The established front-runners to win the rights remain Sky and BT, which recently won the UK rights to broadcast New Zealand and West Indies domestic internationals, including England women’s and men’s tours respectively.  Sky has a deal with the England and Wales Cricket Board until 2024 for home matches, and will be keen to add the Ashes in December to ensure it does not go an entire winter without showing England live. The Ashes is ideal timing for Discovery as it would be able to promote its coverage heavily during and after the Olympics, which will be the streaming service’s most significant test to date.  Coverage of the Games is effectively being shared with the BBC until 2024. The Games are listed as a “Crown Jewel” event, ensuring free-to-air access is guaranteed. However, Discovery believes its streaming service will turn a profit because it is catering its coverage to ensure viewers across Europe can get access to every minute. Andrew Georgiou, president of Eurosport, had previously stated that Discovery+ would be the only place where viewers were guaranteed full access in many European countries. Pricing structures are yet to be settled in the UK, but it was initially set up in America at $4.99 (£3.63) per month, or $6.99 without advertising. Georgiou confirmed that Eurosport’s linear channels would remain unaffected, while Discovery’s GolfTV and Global Cycling Network would retain their identities. English Test cricket returned to free-to-air for the first time since the 2005 Ashes in January, but analysts dismiss the suggestion that the broadcaster’s bargain £5 million marks a seismic shift. Channel 4’s coverage of the India v England Test attracted a peak audience of 1.1 million, double that for Sky Sports’ coverage of the opening day of the previous Sri Lanka-England series."

Telegraph Players of the Year - Ruben Dias: The defender who celebrates blocks as if they were goals
","
The Portugal centre-half, who has laid the foundations for Man City’s charge towards the title, is Telegraph Sport’s Defender of the Year
","Jason Burt, ","

","In a sense  . “I am not a coach for the tackles so I don’t train tackles,” the Manchester City manager famously said. We all know what Guardiola meant – the core beliefs of his football were in different skills – but in Ruben Dias he has a centre-half who not just relishes the physical challenge but one who celebrates a block as if it were scoring a goal. as the Portugal international who arrived at the end of the summer transfer window from Benfica for a club record £65 million and just two days after City had shipped five goals at home against Leicester City. The pressure was on. Dias has not just usurped Aymeric Laporte as City’s primary defender but has played a key role in the return of John Stones who has become a much more robust, aggressive and uncomplicated player through their partnership. It is one Stones has also relished. : there was him physically lifting team-mate Oleksandr Zinchenko into position as he lay behind a defensive wall for a free-kick against Liverpool and there was the sight of him delivering instructions to Zinchenko, Raheem Sterling and goalscorer Ilkay Gundogan after the first goal was scored away at Chelsea. One of the few benefits of empty stadiums is hearing how vocal players can be and Dias is loud. He is a leader. It may be too great a stretch – just yet – to say that in Dias City have finally found their replacement for Vincent Kompany but if he maintains the fine form that has seen him emerge as a strong candidate to be the PFA’s Player of the Year then that comparison will not be too far away from being justified. In Dias’ 38 appearances for City this season there has been a remarkable 24 clean sheets and just 16 goals conceded. Added to that can be six clean sheets in nine games for Portugal. He is, as   columnist Jamie Carragher stated, having  when he signed. And Dias is doing this in his first season in England and at the age of 23. Like Van Dijk, Dias brings calmness and composure, is very comfortable in possession and taking the ball out of defence - which is a Guardiola prerequisite. He has the same imposing physique as Van Dijk and is also mobile. As for the tackles, Dias does not shirk them but, like every good modern defender, he is more adept at interceptions and jockeying an opponent and stealing possession away. “I can assure you that we signed one incredible player for the next five, six years. That is not easy to find,” Guardiola said of Dias and that has to be the fear for the rest of the league as City finally found a solution to a part of the team that was causing concern."

Dickie Bird exclusive: 'Lockdown has been very difficult but Yorkshire put years on my life'
","
Umpiring legend has endured a lonely year of shielding at home yet fresh air, exercise and his cricketing family have kept him going
","Simon Briggs, ","
29 March 2021 • 7:05am
","Dickie Bird’s telephone has rung off the hook over the past fortnight, carrying good wishes from afar. “I had calls from Australia and South Africa,” he says. “Richard Hadlee rang me from New Zealand. I had messages from Alastair Cook – that were nice. I were thinking, ‘How did it get all around the world?’” Bird is talking about the short TV interview he recorded a couple of weeks ago. Speaking to BBC  ’s Ian White in his back garden, his voice cracked with emotion as he described the year he has spent on his own, shielding against Covid. “I’ll tell you now, mate, it’s been really hard.” But the abiding impression was of how well he looked. Here he was, 87 years old, the survivor of a serious stroke in 2010. And yet he impressed White with his exercises, scuttling up and down his lawn with unexpectedly quicksilver feet. When  sent a photographer around last week, he was keen to reprise the performance. “You’ll get some good photos,” he promised. “I have a massive garden with a great view of the Pennines, because there’s a lot of beauty in Yorkshire.” Classic Dickie. As an umpire, he often wore a worried frown, especially when dark clouds massed overhead.  : Norman Wisdom meets Bilbo Baggins. As his biographer David Hopps puts it, “There is no side to Dickie, no threat, no hidden agenda.” He will chat to anyone, whether it be an autograph-hunter carrying one of his half-a-dozen books – which have sold over a million copies between them – or the Queen herself. He calculates that he has met Her Majesty 29 times. What Bird hasn’t been able to do for the last 12 months is welcome any visitors to his home in Barnsley. His niece would normally drop around to clean the place once a week, but that has been a non-starter since the first lockdown. His neighbours pick up the supermarket shopping for him, and leave it on his doorstep, whereupon he makes a valiant – if maladroit – attempt to construct a meal. “I’ve burned so many pans,” he said. “I’ve broken so much crockery. I do find that very difficult. I were the same weight – 11st 6lb – for my whole life, but now I’ve lost a couple of pounds. For a treat, I still go to the Wetherby Whaler takeaway on a Friday night for scampi and onion rings. They say, ‘Stay in the car, Dickie.’” (He drives a Jaguar, courtesy of all those book sales.) “‘We’ll bring it over to you.’” A perennial bachelor, Dickie is coming to regret the size of his four-bedroom cottage. “I try and tidy up myself, I try and hoover, but it’s too big. I could do with a bungalow but I’ve got so much stuff it’s unbelievable, even after I’ve given a lot of my memorabilia away. It’s a bit late to move now, though. When they take me out of this house, they’ll take me out in a coffin.” The term “not-outer” once applied to Dickie’s umpiring, but since Covid-19 confined him to barracks, it could be extended to his lifestyle as well. He has been forced to abandon his usual trips to Headingley for lunch, and to Scarborough for Christmas, where he has many old friends. Apart from the weekly meal at the Wetherby Whaler, his only escape is a daily 90-minute walk, which often takes him across the nearby municipal golf course. “I’ve got the freedom of the city,” he pointed out proudly, “so I can go wherever I want.” Before he even sets out, he spends an hour exercising at home – usually in the garden but in his large bathroom if it rains. His routine revolves around those short sprints that featured in the BBC video. “I come up with my own recipe, always have done,” he said. “You’ve got to watch out, because if you get this mental problem, then that’s serious. You have to get some fresh air. Elderly people like to sit in the house, and watch TV from dawn till dusk. I think it’s a nightmare, doing that.”   The last time I interviewed Dickie, I travelled up to Barnsley in person, and found myself in a kind of shrine. The living-room walls carried framed photos of Bird in his distinctive white cap, poised over the stumps as Imran Khan or Ian Botham charged in. The desk showed off all sorts of keepsakes: here, the giant red book he received from  ; there a miniature replica of the statue that stands just south of Barnsley town centre, a life-size bronze with its index finger raised. There is a typically Bird-ish story about that statue. When it was first erected, weekend revellers treated it like something from an X-rated adventure playground. “They had to give it a plinth, make it six foot higher,” Dickie said. “It was the only way to stop women from climbing up and hanging their bras and panties on my finger!” All very eccentric, and very British, just like Dickie himself. He is not one of those old-stagers who moves with the times; rather, he seems to carry the 1950s around with him. Reading  is a reassuring throwback to a time when the world made sense, as calming to the soul as picking up an Agatha Christie or an Arthur Ransome. Remarkably, it remains the most successful volume in the history of British sports publishing, even if no one fully understands how the umpire became bigger than the game. When I asked Dickie’s publisher Roddy Bloomfield for an explanation, he referred me to “the extraordinary sight of this small man standing in the middle, pointing his finger in the face of these 6ft 8in fast bowlers and telling them what’s what. For many people, especially casual viewers, that’s more interesting than a batsman hitting a six.” Ah, yes, casual viewers. Dickie’s appeal extends to the most unlikely people. In 1998, the American horror-writing legend Stephen King took a spontaneous diversion from a book-signing tour to visit the cricket at Trent Bridge, and bonded at once with his fellow author. “Dickie gave him a three-hour tour of the pavilion,” Bloomfield recalled. “They got on famously and Dickie went away with a copy of  , even though he’s never read a word about anything outside cricket.” If there is one thing missing from Dickie’s narrative, it is a chapter on romance. His books are a largely female-free zone, apart from a brief mention of an unnamed South African girl in the 1960s, which gives off a distinct “my girlfriend goes to another school” vibe. Looking back, he says he would have loved children of his own – and indeed he has donated many thousands to the cardiac unit at Great Ormond Street Hospital, “for their tiny hearts”. But marriage? That was never a realistic prospect for someone who spent four straight decades on the road. As Hopps points out, “Dickie must be one of the most loved lonely men – certainly solitary men – in the world.” Fortunately, this son of a miner belongs to a different kind of family: Yorkshire County Cricket Club, which he joined all the way back in 1956 after a knee injury had wrecked his hopes of a football career. If there is a great love story in Bird’s life, this is it. He has contributed financially to the cause, spending £125,000 on the Dickie Bird Players’ Balcony at Headingley. But the emotional ties reach far deeper. “Like most people, Dickie has had his down moments over the winter,” said Yorkshire’s director of cricket, Martyn Moxon, one of several club bigwigs who have called him regularly to chat about sport and generally gee him up. “Overall, though, he is remarkably well, given that he is on his own. In fact, judging by that BBC film, he runs better than me.” It’s heartwarming to witness how much progress Bird has made since my last visit to Barnsley eight years ago. He was still struggling then with the after-effects of his stroke, which left him gloomy and often tearful. That spring morning in 2013, he hadn’t even made it out of bed when I dropped by, which was alarmingly out of character for a man who used to arrive four hours early for a Test match or a chinwag with the Queen. At that stage, his oft-stated maxim that “the characters are going out of the game” seemed liable to apply to Dickie himself. Again, Yorkshire rode to the rescue. Their decision to elect him club president in 2014 proved transformative. “It put years on my life,” he told me, “because I hadn’t been well before. I went all over, riding in the team bus in my club sweater and tie. I didn’t miss a match. It gave me a chance to see old friends, catch up with people I used to know before I retired. I came away a new man.” Dickie takes great pride in the fact that Yorkshire won back-to-back county championships during his two-year term. “That’s never been done in history!” he barks, with childlike glee. “And we haven’t won it since, so some of the members have been saying ‘Bring back Dickie Bird!’” Bring back Dickie Bird? After this toughest of modern winters, it feels like he’s back already."

Hege Riise: Timing of Olympics email which left snubbed keeper in tears was 'big mistake'
","
Plus: Analysis of England's options in Steph Houghton's absence as Riise announces squad for friendlies against France and Canada
","Tom Garry, ","
30 March 2021 • 3:20pm
","Team GB and England head coach Hege Riise says it was a ""big mistake"" that several players found out they were not on the Olympics squad shortlist shortly before kick-off in a Women’s Super League game earlier in March. Birmingham manager Carla Ward criticised the ""thoughtless"" and ""ridiculous"" timing which left her 20-year-old goalkeeper  "" 90 minutes before she faced Everton. It is understood Riise did not send the emails. ""The timing was not my call, but it was not how we want to work,"" Riise said. ""That was a big mistake. As soon as we found out, I called both the coaches and Hannah [Hampton] to apologise for the process. That was a mistake that we don’t want to happen again."" Norway great Riise, who  , has whittled down a shortlist of 35 players who remain in contention for a spot in the small 18-player Team GB squad for this summer’s Tokyo games. Before then, her focus will be on April’s England friendlies against France and Canada and on Tuesday she named a 24-player Lionesses squad. England captain Steph Houghton misses out with an Achilles injury, and Riise said Houghton was somebody you cannot replace but it was a chance for others ""to step up"". Forward Nikita Parris is also unavailable after several people tested positive for Covid-19 at her club side Lyon. That localised outbreak may yet hit April 9’s fixture against France in Caen, but it is not yet known how many of the French national side are affected. Riise added: ""We don’t want to risk anything but our plan is to go to France and play. We haven’t heard anything different."" Veteran goalkeepers Karen Bardsley and Carly Telford have both been recalled to the squad, while Birmingham’s Hampton misses out, with four shot-stoppers named in the squad, increasing from three in February. Manchester City No 1 Ellie Roebuck and Everton keeper Sandy MacIver remain in the squad alongside the returning Bardsley and Telford, while among the outfield players Chelsea’s versatile youngster Niamh Charles has been called up for the first time and might provide backup to Lucy Bronze at right-back. Bristol City's 20-year-old striker   misses out after her first call-up in February, while there is still no place for in-form  , nor Everton midfielder Izzy Christiansen. The absence of Houghton will be the most notable challenge for England to deal with. Manchester City’s 32-year-old skipper has earned 121 caps for her country and has been near ever-present for the Lionesses since being handed the armband by former head coach Mark Sampson in 2014. Midfielder Jill Scott, who collected her 150th cap last time out in   could be in line to wear the armband again, after being named captain for sentimental reasons for that landmark appearance. Fifa   could also be in contention, along with striker Ellen White and some younger names. ""There will always be players that cannot come into due to injury and things we cannot control,"" Riise said. ""But I feel like that’s a chance for others to step up. Steph’s been captain and a major player for a long time. We can’t replace her, but it’s an opportunity for a younger player to step up."" At centre-back, England have vast options to choose from. Houghton’s injury could give Arsenal duo Leah Williamson and Lotte Wubben-Moy a chance to start at centre-back, either as a partnership or with one of them alongside Chelsea’s Millie Bright, while Manchester United’s Millie Turner could also push for a place. Manchester City left-back Demi Stokes has returned to the squad after injury, which may in turn provide yet another option at centre-back, because her club team-mate and fellow left-back   has proven herself to be equally capable of slotting in as a left-side centre-half. But with Houghton - if fit - among the few players surely certain of a space among the 18 for Tokyo, the upcoming England games will showcase the strong competition for places behind her.  Ellie Roebuck, Sandy MacIver, Carly Telford, Karen Bardsley Lucy Bronze, Rachel Daly, Niamh Charles, Leah Williamson, Millie Turner, Millie Bright, Lotte Wubben-Moy, Demi Stokes, Alex Greenwood.  Keira Walsh, Georgia Stanway, Ella Toone, Jill Scott, Jordan Nobbs  Fran Kirby, Lauren Hemp, Chloe Kelly, Bethany England, Ellen White, Beth Mead"

Why Newcastle won't sack Steve Bruce despite their perilous Premier League position
","
As long as Bruce has the backing of owner Mike Ashley, he will be backed to pull Newcastle out of the mess they are in
",Luke Edwards,"
30 March 2021 • 7:30am
","Trying to make sense out of the nonsensical has been a consistent feature of Mike Ashley’s 14-year reign as Newcastle United owner. In fact, it would make a decent book title when it comes to assessing the damage his decisions have inflicted on a club trapped in a constant state of mediocrity and frustration. Even so, Ashley’s decision not to sack Steve Bruce as head coach following a   before the international break, that left the Magpies in clear and present danger of a third relegation to the Championship since 2009, is one of his most controversial calls. Bruce is the manager very few Newcastle supporters wanted when he replaced Rafa Benitez, just three weeks before the first game of the 2019/20 campaign. And nobody seems to have any faith in him to get them out of trouble 20 months later, with 95 per cent of the 12,000 supporters who took part in a survey by the Newcastle Chronicle, wanting Bruce to be removed in results published on Monday. After a run of two wins in 20 games that has left the Magpies just two points above the relegation zone, most clubs would have sacked Bruce, looking for a “new manager bounce” to try and lift them clear of the drop zone. Yet, Ashley has never listened to supporter angst and has not been bullied into making a decision, whether it concerns the running of his retail empire or his football club. It has always been done his way, rightly or wrongly, and that is not about to change.  Sources have indicated that while Bruce was stung by the result of the survey in the local paper he used to read growing up, they were dismissed as unhelpful noise by others at the club and ignored. So,  , given the almost universal opposition to his continued presence among supporters, as well as local media commentators? Newcastle have looked and sounded divided ever since colourful details of a training ground bust-up between Bruce and winger Matt Ritchie were leaked to a national newspaper earlier this month. There were claims that some players had given up on Bruce too and wanted him to be replaced. There were accusations that the squad were given too many days off and even suggestions in a series of follow-up attacks that Bruce was waiting to be sacked in order to receive his £4million pay off.  In reality, there are some players, mainly those who are not playing regularly, who have an axe to grind. Others remain both supportive and loyal to the manager and were furious about the leaks. Regardless, it was incendiary stuff and helped whip up opposition to Bruce to new levels of toxicity, even before the awful performance at Brighton. Ashley, though, took a rather different view and rather than sack his head coach, he has been inclined to back him even more. Not only because he likes Bruce and feels he has been treated unfairly by the local media on Tyneside, as well as fans, but because he expects more from the players too.  The perception is they have been content to hide behind an unpopular manager and avoid criticism of their own shortcomings and mistakes. The mantra this week has been play for the crest on the shirt. Nothing else should matter. From the moment the Ritchie bust-up story appeared in a national newspaper and was followed up by more negative leaks, Ashley took the view that Bruce had been betrayed by others he also employs. He was furious, as was managing director Lee Charnley and the other members of Ashley’s inner circle. They felt there was a concerted attempt from a person or people, acting purely out of self interest, looking to undermine the club, the team and, of course Bruce. At the precise time they were expected to pull together to get out of trouble, there were people intending to cause even more of it.  If the leaks and coverage were designed to enforce the removal of Bruce, it had the opposite effect. For the majority of fans, it is misguided loyalty from Ashley to the point of neglect, failing to realise that unless there is a change in the dugout, Newcastle will go down. Those around him have advised differently.  The attacks on both men have been severe and sustained. But Ashley will not be pressured into anything and Bruce will not resign, steadfastly believing he is the man to guide the team out of the mess he has got them into. It is a huge gamble. Nobody at St James’ Park is denying that privately, but it is the decision they have made.  When you have appointed a new manager in March and April before — Alan Shearer in 2009 and Rafa Benitez in 2016 — to try and avoid relegation and still gone down, why not stick this time and let things play out? The feeling is Newcastle may only need another nine or ten points from their remaining nine games to be safe and that, they feel, is achievable with Bruce in charge. For his part, Bruce has sounded too defeatist too often. His approach has lacked conviction. He has looked to shirk blame and has become embroiled in a battle with his critics in the media, coverage that has merely reflected supporter dismay at what has unfolded this season. Something has to change and at least his tone has. But tough, confident and abrasive talk needs to be reflected in performances. The players need to rally behind the manager, not hide. Much was made last week of the fact that the players had been given six days off in the international break and were not hauled into training on the Sunday after the Brighton capitulation.  That was due to Covid testing protocols, with testing pre-arranged for those players not on international duty later in the week.  But why were the players given additional days off — six in total during the international break — when they could have been preparing for this weekend’s game against Tottenham Hotspur? Interestingly, the report detailing the number of days off did concern the Newcastle hierarchy and an investigation was carried out, but the result of it may surprise Bruce’s many critics. Newcastle’s players have had fewer days off training this season than they have in each of the past five years at the same stage of the campaign and the data was there to prove it. It was also a schedule designed with the club’s specialist fitness and medical staff, with the view the players need to rest, both mentally and physically, is more important than ever after a summer without a break from football. The hope is the days off will help avoid any more fatigue related injuries this season. Like the decision not to sack Bruce, only time will tell if it was the right call or not."

Transfer notebook: Manchester United's goalkeeper dilemma and Liverpool eye young France defender
","
Solskjaer is expected to stick with one goalkeeper, rather than regularly change, for the business end of the season
",Mike McGrath,"
30 March 2021 • 12:16pm
","Ole Gunnar Solskjaer will now have to choose between Dean Henderson and David De Gea as Manchester United’s No 1 for the rest of the season after giving both a chance to impress.  Henderson played in six games before joining up with England for the international break, with De Gea granted time to return to Spain for the birth of his first child and requiring time to quarantine on his return.   With nine Premier League games left in the campaign and a place in the Champions League to secure, Solskjaer is expected to stick with one goalkeeper rather than regularly change for the business end of the season.  Henderson has staked a strong claim in the last month with clean sheets against Crystal Palace, Manchester City and West Ham. Simon Kjaer's goal for AC Milan in the Europa League could have been prevented but he kept the Italians out in the second leg.  He signed a new contract last summer when he returned from Sheffield United and was told he would get his chance at some point during the season. De Gea, who is approaching 10 years at Old Trafford, was picked for most of United’s Premier League games and has been publicly backed by Solskajer after mistakes.  De Gea’s contract has another two seasons to run with the option of a further year and his wages of around £350,000 a week would be the biggest obstacle for a club to look at buying him.  Liverpool will get the first run at signing Ibrahima Konaté from RB Leipzig this summer as their rivals have other priorities in the window.  Jurgen Klopp is the frontrunner for the France Under-21 centre-back and can move swiftly as he has no players to shift first before moving for a long-term centre-back.   Chelsea would look at selling one of their four first-team centre-backs before making a move for another defender, while Tottenham are in the same position.  Manchester United are looking signing a centre-back this summer but will look at other areas, including right wing, before deciding on a budget for alternative players.  Bulgaria forward Kiril Despodov is taking legal action against Cagliari over unpaid wages and wants a release from his contract.  The 24 year-old, who scored against Switzerland last week, will be a sought-after free agent if he is successful in his dispute with the Italian club.   Serie A clubs were given permission to pay players over 14 months last season due to the coronavirus pandemic but Despodov was told he was not entitled to wages for July and August after he returned from a loan.  “The dispute is pending in front of an Italian arbitration panel, with a decision expected shortly. Fifpro is closely following the matter,” read a statement from the world players’ union.  Luton Town striker James Collins is attracting interest with his contract due to expire at Kenilworth Road in the summer.  The 30 year-old has helped his club to two promotions and has reached double figures for goals in his two seasons in the Championship. Preston and Derby are among a host of clubs who are monitoring his situation but there is also interest from MLS clubs in America."

Rating the F1 teams after the Bahrain GP: Are Red Bull fastest and are Aston Martin in trouble?
","
We dive deep into the data from the opening round to see which teams will be happy and which teams are facing a potential nightmare season
",Luke Slater,"
30 March 2021 • 7:24am
","The 2021 Formula One season is underway with a bang after arguably the  . For the first time since 2018 Mercedes have genuine competition at the front, this time from Red Bull. It is promising for a captivating season ahead and a  . But are Red Bull actually the quickest team? Will Mercedes and Hamilton need to be at the very top of their game just to compete, as was the case on Sunday? And what about the rest of the grid? Now that we've had a decent amount of competitive running, it is a little easier to see the overall picture.  We have carefully sifted through the numbers and data to work out who the real winners and losers of F1's opening weekend were, and what this means for the season ahead.  As well as qualifying and race performance, we looked at a team's overall position as well as their progress relative to a) their average last season and b) the first race last year. We have combined this to create a progress percentage on their raw pace.  The overall rankings, then, are as much a chart of improvement as anything, rather than the ""correct"" order. So, who should be quietly confident and who is facing a long season ahead? Even on the limited running we have seen so far, Haas look to be in a similar position to Williams in 2019. That is to say they will be hopelessly adrift of even the second slowest team for the entirety of the year.  Given that they say they are not developing the current VF21 at all this season and the fact that they have two rookies   and Nikita Mazepin, this will be a long and painful season. The primary aim will be to bring their young drivers up to speed but with so little experience behind the wheel of a car that looks problematic, you have to question the wisdom of this.  No team has moved further back since 2020 and that is likely to be the direction of travel throughout 2021, too.   -1.050% (10th) There is still a long way to go yet but this has been a troubling start to the  . As Racing Point last season they were probably the third quickest team, on balance, with their Mercedes W10 imitation. And just like the actual Mercedes team this year, there is no doubt they have moved backwards in the order.  Despite Lance Stroll making it into final qualifying, Aston Martin were the seventh quickest team in Bahrain on raw pace behind the usual back three of Alfa Romeo, Williams and Haas. They are some way down on their 2020 level, with midfield rivals McLaren, AlphaTauri and Ferrari all making progress of varying degrees.  Their race showing was a little better but they now face a dilemma. Ideally the 2022 regulation changes – and F1’s new era – should be the focus of their resources, but with a start this poor the team may need to put their efforts into making this car better or face a demoralising season. Force India were very good at in-season improvement and that quality looks needed here.   -0.404% (8th) The team formerly known as Renault now have Fernando Alonso at the helm. He did his best throughout the Bahrain Grand Prix, but the A521 looked sluggish. Esteban Ocon did not fare much better, either, finishing a lap down in 13th and behind both Alfa Romeo cars. The team have made absolute progress from last year (only three teams did not) but their relative progress – which is more important – is backwards.  Again, like Aston Martin they face the “development dilemma”. No team wants to struggle outside the points for an entire year, going backwards and not forwards. But resource may be best spent on working on their 2022 car.  There is still a chance that the team and drivers can understand the car and its behaviour better as the season goes on, but you do wonder if the Renault power unit is the primary cause of its lack of pace. In   we said that the window for Alpine this year could be anywhere between third and seventh. With McLaren, Alfa Romeo, Ferrari and AlphaTauri all on the up, seventh looks the more likely outcome.   +0.167% (7th) With new owners and  , the hopes at Williams would have been to continue their progress and turn it into something tangible; creating a car that can occasionally score points. On the showing in Bahrain they may have moved forward a little in overall performance but they sit in a similar place to 2020, albeit moving ahead of Haas in the order.  George Russell again made it into Q2 whilst team-mate Nicholas Latifi did not. This could be a common theme again in 2021. On everything we have seen so far, Williams risk being caught in no man’s land in ninth place – well ahead of Haas behind but well behind of whoever is ahead, whether Alfa Romeo, Aston Martin or Alpine.  +0.516% (5th)  It appears that the new aero regulations for 2021 have affected Mercedes and Racing Point – with their low-rake philosophy – more than the other teams. This, combined with Red Bull making a big step forward with their car’s stability and overall performance, has set up a mouthwatering season ahead.  Ninth in the overall progress chart looks worse than it is , but that is largely due to a stellar season in 2020. The only way was down after that.  It will be interesting to see whether they focus much on developing the W12 or look towards next year. Still, unlike the smaller teams, they should have the resource to do both. Clearly, there are still some issues. Although the car looked a match for Red Bull in the hands of Hamilton in the race, a gap of four-tenths in qualifying will be a little concerning, even with 22 rounds left in the championship.   -0.435% (9th) After pre-season testing there was a hint that McLaren could have moved ahead of the midfield pack. On the weekend’s showing it does not look like they have managed that yet, with only a small absolute improvement from last year. This should not be cause for concern.  Their biggest concern will be looking at the teams directly behind them with Ferrari resurgent and AlphaTauri on the up, too. Their consistent pace and performances throughout a season were their strengths in 2020 and it should be the same this time, especially with Lando Norris and Daniel Ricciardo on board.   +0.160% (6th) Alfa Romeo top the progress charts, having made a huge step forward in raw pace from both their 2020 overall time and their performance in the first race of last season. For most of last year they were cut adrift with Haas and Williams but this year there should be much more chance of success: that is to say points.  Perhaps the Ferrari power unit has helped but Alfa Romeo will be one of the teams most pleased with their performance so far. Despite being the eighth fastest team in Bahrain – where they were last year –   it is not out of the question that they could prove obstacles for Alpine and Aston Martin in the next few races and beyond.   +1.331% (1st)  Like McLaren, Ferrari would have had hopes that they could leap ahead of the midfield pack on their own. Like McLaren, that does not look to be the case. After pre-season testing there were questions over whether they might even struggle to improve all that much on last year’s dismal showing. First impressions, however, look decent.  Charles Leclerc showed the car’s potential with fourth in qualifying, just a couple of tenths behind Valtteri Bottas in the second Mercedes. Carlos Sainz could have been closer too, but did not nail his Q3 lap. Sixth and eighth in the final reckoning is hardly reason to crack out the bubbly but given that this is a track which rewards power, then Ferrari can feel cautiously optimistic about the season ahead. It will be a tight fight with McLaren, but third place is a target.   +0.763% (4th)  Red Bull can leave Bahrain disappointed but happy overall. Their pre-season pace was not an illusion and they begin the season with the fastest car and a man capable of delivering the best from it in Max Verstappen. The worry will be whether they can keep up with Mercedes – or keep them at bay in qualifying – for very long.  The 0.388secs that separated Verstappen and Hamilton in qualifying was significant. But the performance gap between Red Bull and Mercedes was, well, almost impossible to call even after 56 laps. With so many races this year and a huge variety of tracks, it is likely we will see the order see-sawing but, whatever, the RB16B looks a seriously impressive car and already arguably their best of the turbo-hybrid era.  Development throughout the season has usually been their strong point. It has had to be, as the team have been painfully slow starters. The giants they have to fell in Hamilton and Mercedes are now within touching distance, but it appears that it will take a monumental effort to down them.  +0.782% (3rd) It might seem strange to have a team that only scored two points with one ninth place at the top of this list. That was the case with Racing Point after the first race of last year and it is the same with AlphaTauri this year. Their potential is enormous, but they did not deliver on it on Sunday.  Pierre Gasly has always gone well in Bahrain but qualifying fifth is a fantastic result. Yuki Tsunoda could have been up there as well – and he looks a serious prospect – but for a mistake in Q2. Gasly made contact with Daniel Ricciardo early on and that ruined his race, but it is not an exaggeration to say that they could cause headaches for Ferrari and McLaren this year on current form.  Going by the data, the Honda engine seems to be a massive upgrade on last year’s, which should serve them well. Aerodynamically the car – like its sister at Red Bull – appears compliant to the drivers’ will. There are many reasons to be excited for the Italian team this year.   +0.972% (2nd) "

The truth about why Wojciech Szczesny left Arsenal
","
Sold by Arsenal for just £10m, Poland goalkeeper Szczesny is now Juventus' No 1 and Frank Lampard showed an interest last summer
","Matt Law, ","
30 March 2021 • 7:30am
","Wojciech Szczesny had  out of the Roma team for an entire season when Arsenal’s former transfer chief Dick Law delivered the news he had not wanted to hear. Despite spending two years on loan at Roma, Szczesny had bought a new house in the Totteridge area of Barnet and had not given up on resuming his career at the Emirates. But Law told him that he would be third choice behind Petr Cech and David Ospina under manager Arsene Wenger, leaving the Pole no choice but to seek a permanent move away from Arsenal and his performances in Italy earned him a transfer to Juventus. That was four years ago and Szczesny will return to England on Wednesday night with the Poland squad as the man who has kept both Alisson and Gianluigi Buffon on the sidelines, and stopped Juventus spending big on Gianluigi Donnarumma. He has also started Poland’s last two games, against Hungary and Andorra, ahead of his former Arsenal team-mate Lukasz Fabianski.  It was only a year after Juventus signed Szczesny for £10million that Liverpool made his old Roma understudy Alisson the world’s most expensive goalkeeper by signing him for £66.8m before  Arsenal, it could be claimed, had not judged the market well and it was in the summer of 2018 that Szczesny was officially given the task of succeeding arguably the best goalkeeper of all-time in Turin, as Buffon joined Paris Saint-Germain, and he has not looked back. “In Roma, I put on the bench the best goalkeeper in the world, in Juventus the best in history,” said Szczesny in 2019. “It turns out that I am the best in the world and in history!” Szczesny was clearly joking, but he has certainly developed into one of the best goalkeepers in the world which is reflected by the fact that the last contract he signed with Juventus put him second only to  And while the disappointing performances of Juventus in the Champions League have perhaps prevented Szczesny getting some of the credit outside Italy that he has deserved, those within the game are well aware of his talent. Former Chelsea head coach Frank Lampard showed an interest in trying to bring Szczesny back to England last summer, before the Blues signed Edouard Mendy, but, having learned the language and quickly settled into the lifestyle, the 30-year-old could not be happier in Italy. In his second season at Roma, Szcesny kept the most clean sheets in Serie A, as Alisson watched from the bench, and after taking over from Buffon he earned a nomination for the Yashin Trophy - the prize to recognise the world’s best goalkeeper over the course of the campaign. Last season, Szczesny won his third Serie A title with Juventus and was named the best goalkeeper in Italy. But perhaps the greatest acknowledgement of Szczesny’s performances was the fact that Buffon, on returning to the club, turned down his offer to take back his old number one shirt and instead insisted on wearing the number 77 in recognition of the fact he was no longer first-choice. Just how and why Arsenal let one of the world’s best goalkeepers slip through their fingers for a relative pittance remains a sore point among some of the club’s supporters, even allowing for some poor moments of judgement on and off the pitch and a confidence in his own ability that could border on arrogance. Having kept 16 clean sheets, Szczesny finished the 2013-14 season as the joint holder of the Premier League’s Golden Glove award with Cech, who was still at Chelsea, and had delighted Arsenal fans by posting a video of himself playing ‘We won the League at White Hart Lane’ on the piano the day after a North London derby victory over Tottenham Hotspur. But problems started to pile up in the following campaign, as Szczesny conceded a penalty and was sent-off in a Champions League game against Galatasaray, and was caught smoking in the changing-room showers after making mistakes for both of the goals in a defeat to Southampton. Szczesny was fined £20,000 and lost his Premier League place to Ospina following the smoking incident, but it was not just a crafty cigarette and a couple of mistakes that had annoyed Wenger. Not satisfied with the training methods of Wenger’s trusted goalkeeping coach Gerry Peyton, Szczesny would arrive at Arsenal’s London Colney training ground at 7am to go through a session with one of the club’s other coaches - something the Frenchman disapproved of. The clash of personalities between Szczesny and Peyton was laid bare in an interview filmed in Poland, in which the goalkeeper appeared with his international team-mate Fabianski, who has also been a success at Swansea City and West Ham United since leaving the Emirates on a free transfer when his contract expired in 2014. Describing a video analysis session that Peyton put on for Arsenal’s goalkeepers at the time, Szczesny said: “We’re going not knowing what it will be about, right? And it’s a four to five minute video of goals that I let past me, but could have done better.” Fabianski added: “It’s only Szczesny goals though. They were only Szczesny’s mistakes, but there was us and Vito (Vito Mannone) and maybe Emi (Emiliano Martinez) watching.” Szczesny finished by saying: “So, we’re watching, but we don’t know what is going on. It’s just showing errors, he (Peyton) is not explaining anything. So the video ends and Gerry says ‘See, you’re not perfect’. And that was it. We’re all looking at each other like ‘oh’.” He may not have been perfect, but there have not been many better than Szczesny since Wenger decided that he was not even Arsenal’s second-best goalkeeper."

Lewis Hamilton exceeded track limits nearly 30 times - so why was Max Verstappen punished?
","
Verstappen and Hamilton's issues were fundamentally different, but both men were right to feel confused at the FIA's inconsistency
",Luke Slater,"
29 March 2021 • 3:13pm
","Sunday’s   delivered all that and more than F1 fans would have expected. Lewis Hamilton held off a charging Max Verstappen in the closing laps to take a stunning victory and, for the first time in some years, it looks like we have a   on our hands.  Yet there was still plenty of debate and controversy in how the rules over “track limits” were being enforced. We break down what took place below.  It was ultimately a culmination of issues which led to confusion in the middle of the race and Verstappen handing back the lead to Hamilton within moments of taking it. However, these are two separate issues.   One was drivers running off the track on the exit of turn four, meaning they could carry more speed through the corner apex and define the track in a more favourable way to gain lap time. This was monitored and punished in qualifying, but not the race – at least initially.  Hamilton repeatedly left the track at turn four before being warned not to by his team or he would run the risk of a five-second penalty. Verstappen tried to avoid leaving the track at turn four – as he thought it was not permitted – and did so until his team informed him that Mercedes were consistently doing so and were not being penalised. He then changed his approach.  The second issue was Verstappen completing his overtake of Hamilton off the track, which is not legal. But should the Dutchman have given the position back, or charged off ahead and tried to negate a potential five or 10-second penalty? Initially, the Race Directors’ notes ahead of the weekend simply read: “The track limits at the exit of Turn 4 will not be monitored with regard to setting a lap time, as the defining limits are the artificial grass and the gravel trap in that location.”  However, this was later updated (after first practice) to: “A lap time achieved during any practice session by leaving the track and cutting behind the red and white kerb on the exit of Turn 4, will result in that lap time being invalidated by the stewards.” It was made clear that previous note about them not being monitored only applied to the race, and drivers and teams were also referred to Article 27.3 of the Sporting Regulations.  This states: “Drivers must make every reasonable effort to use the track at all times and may not leave the track without a justifiable reason”.  “Should a car leave the track the driver may re-join… without gaining any lasting advantage. At the absolute discretion of the Race Director a driver may be given the opportunity to give back the whole of any advantage he gained by leaving the track.” A “lasting” advantage clearly refers to position, as a small lap time advantage on its own is not lasting. A single lap time advantage repeated over 30-odd laps though? That is an interesting question and perhaps one which belatedly occurred to Race Control in the middle of the race, forcing them into action.  On Monday, the FIA Race Director Michael Masi confirmed that the overtaking incident involving Verstappen was “quite different” to Hamilton’s repeated transgressions of track limits, and thus was judged accordingly. According to Reuters, Masi said that Verstappen breached the sporting regulations which are always in force regardless of pre-race briefings because the Dutchman “gained a lasting advantage by overtaking another car off the racetrack”. Masi also confirmed that he directly told Red Bull to order Verstappen to return first place to Hamilton immediately after he had put all four wheels outside the track limits. During the race, Verstappen was frustrated when he was told that Hamilton and Bottas were frequently exceeding track limits at turn four. “How is that legal, man? The whole weekend we couldn’t do it,” he said. He also immediately questioned his team’s decision to tell him to let Hamilton by. “Why didn’t you just let me go? I could have easily pulled those five [penalty] seconds,” Verstappen said. “I’d prefer to lose a win like that than be second like this.” “We had the instruction from race control unfortunately Max,” team principal Christian Horner replied.  However, once he was out of the car his position had mellowed. Immediately after the race, he said “I knew that I ran out of the track limits, yeah, and then at turn eight they told me, so I gave the position back out of 10. It is what it is.” By the time he went into the post-race press conference with the written press, he had accepted that it was the right thing to do to give the place back to Hamilton.  Remarkably, he even said that he did not give it back on the pit straight as it would have been “unfair”, because he would have had a better chance to overtake on the second straight with the aid of DRS.  After the race, Horner expressed frustration at the grey area of track limits and its enforcement in Bahrain.  Hamilton reacted with dismay when he was told during the race to stay inside track limits at turn four or risk a penalty.  “I thought there were no track limits… I have been doing the same thing all race,” he said.  In fairness, he had a point – he was not aware that they would be enforcing this so strictly, or even at all. An onboard video shows he   before he was warned by his race engineer to stop.  After the race he described the situation as “confusing” and said that the FIA “changed their minds” half-way through the race, before adding that it ultimately helped extend his tyre life and that he was “grateful” for the call.  Verstappen giving the lead back to Hamilton is fair enough. It was an illegal overtake and, thankfully, his actions saved us from a thrilling race being (again) decided in the stewards’ room hours after the chequered flag fell.  Could Red Bull have let him try and get five seconds ahead? At that point it may have been possible, but it looked like he would soon have another opportunity to pass Hamilton. That was not the case, as his car struggled in Hamilton’s dirty air. Before passing Hamilton on lap 53 he was roughly 0.5secs a lap quicker, so it seems unlikely he could have made the five seconds in four laps.  The bigger issue comes with the inconsistency in how track limits were being applied to the drivers, with Red Bull and Mercedes taking differing approaches throughout the race.  It seems Red Bull were wrong and Mercedes right in the first instance. Red Bull should have been wiser here. Track limits at turn four were not going to be enforced during the race, other than with overtaking. That much was clear, or so they thought.  Red Bull first changed tack after seeing Mercedes running wide but then Mercedes told Hamilton to rein it in after being warned by Race Control. So, what changed in the middle of the race? Was it Hamilton’s repeated “infringements”? But infringements of what – track limits were, at that point, not being enforced.  Clearly, much better communication and action must be in place for future races. It would perhaps be best to err on the side of caution and stop drivers running off the track and then stick to it.  It is a terrible look to have a clear, written note to say that track limits would not be enforced in the race, only to start to enforce it half-way through the race when drivers continue to take advantage of it. What did they think would happen? Hopefully a lesson will be learned. "

Liverpool remain in hunt for centre-back - but what kind of defender are they looking for?
","
Jurgen Klopp's side are endeavouring to ensure they never find themselves in same situation that decimated their title ambitions this season
",Chris Bascombe,"
30 March 2021 • 10:55am
","Clubs tend to be reluctant to make promises before a transfer window, but there is one guarantee at Liverpool: Jurgen Klopp will be signing a centre-back this summer. Given  , that underlines how desperate those final hours were in January when the sense of emergency meant   and Preston North End’s Ben Davies ought to have been driven into the training ground at full speed in a police car with the siren screeching. In the subsequent months, those deals have looked even more of an expedient means to an end. No sooner was Kabak measuring up for his jersey than it was emphasised his loan spell does not include an obligation to buy - the inference being Liverpool are more hopeful than certain of the Turkish youngster’s long-term status. At £2 million Davies, still to make his debut, was cheap enough to buy in the knowledge that if he does not make the step up Anfield, his fee will be recouped later. Davies may be reassured by Klopp comparing the start of his Liverpool career to   - the Scotland skipper rarely seen for six months and trying to dislodge Alberto Moreno before making the position his. Even if we finally get a glimpse of Davies in the next two months, realistically the best he can hope for when the cavalry returns is to be fifth choice, presumably waiting for a Carabao Cup or FA Cup tie if a desirable loan move does not grab his or the club’s attention first. Even that will depend on  , or (as seems more likely) uses his promotion this season as a platform to become first choice elsewhere. Neither Kabak nor Davies can be under any illusions about their position in the pecking order once Virgil van Dijk, Joel Matip and Joe Gomez emerge from their long rehabilitation. Neither could they turn down an opportunity which would never have arisen but for the senior defenders’ injuries. Liverpool’s attempts to sign others in the same window is proof January was the antithesis of how they and other clubs prefer to operate - it was all about an attempted quick fix because more desirable targets were unavailable or (because of the inflated valuations mid-season) unaffordable. Had Croatian Duje Caleta-Car been allowed to leave Marseille for Anfield rather than stuck on a runway on a private plane which never took off, it may not be so certain Liverpool would again be scouring the market for defenders. The same could be said if the price for Brighton’s Ben White was not so prohibitive, especially as his club was never going to sanction a deal in the midst of a relegation fight. Liverpool also like  , while on Monday it emerged RB Leipzig’s Ibrahima Konate is among those under serious consideration, especially as he has a £35 million buy-out clause in his contract, thus reducing the need for a prolonged negotiation. That kind of price will seem even more attractive if alternatives are quoted at £50 million-plus by reluctant sellers. The credentials, value and availability of these players remains under assessment, so Liverpool insist they have made no decision yet on who they will most actively pursue and sign. As last summer proved, Liverpool are not averse to conducting negotiations simultaneously as they bid for left-back Jamal Lewis (then at Norwich) a matter of days before signing Olympiacos’ Kostas Tsimikas, and waited to see how firm Watford’s stance was on Ismaila Sarr’s valuation before deciding he was too expensive and finalising terms for Wolves’ Diogo Jota. On the surface, the fact Liverpool are openly looking for alternatives beyond their current squad does not bode well for Kabak and his chances of retaining his shirt beyond this summer.  When asked about that recently, Klopp was non-committal. That public stance is unlikely to change with the youngster preparing for the biggest few months of his career with Liverpool’s Champions League quarter-final against Real Madrid and the European Championships with his country.  Kabak made an indifferent start to his Liverpool career,  . Klopp will want him motivated by the enduring hope of making his temporary move permanent rather than deflated by the idea he is already fighting a lost cause staying beyond the summer. That may partially explain why even if Liverpool were to strike a deal behind the scenes they may see little value in confirming anything while their on-loan centre-back still has so much to play for.   What is clear is Liverpool are endeavouring to ensure they never find themselves in the same situation that decimated their Premier League ambitions in 2020/21. There are plenty who saw an accident-in-waiting by going into this campaign with only three senior centre-backs. Others believe retrospective wisdom has been applied because to lose all three to long-term injuries is unprecedented. But after a year of makeshift centre-backs, Klopp can plan to have four top-class ones to choose from next August, thus ensuring he no longer has to re-accommodate Fabinho and Jordan Henderson in the role.  once Klopp has the luxury of having several high-class and fully --fit candidates fighting for the right to partner van Dijk, rather than the unenviable and impossible one of filling the Grand Canyon-sized hole in his absence."
sport,,,,,"Whatever your allegiance in this year’s Six Nations, you cannot say it was a dull championship. It was one of the most discussed and most entertaining tournaments in recent memory with some critiques being germane and others inapposite. The truth is, Italy aside, and whatever the final table standings, the other five teams were separated by the finest of margins. With a different decision here or a play coming off there, it could all have looked so different. Analysing what went right and wrong for the teams, you must look at more than their finishing positions. Any talk of Wales being lucky champions is nonsense.   and created and converted more of their opportunities. Their experienced players returned to form and their blooded youngsters successfully negotiated the challenge of stepping up from club to international rugby. The work done by Wayne Pivac as head coach and assistants Jonathan Humphreys, Stephen Jones and Gethin Jenkins meant that, in defence and attack,   and makes them difficult to beat. Wales’ progress was an all-round effort, the challenge now being to maintain the upward curve all the way to 2023. There is nothing to suggest they cannot do this, other than the retirement of the talismanic Alun Wyn Jones. That he will retire is certain; that he will be seamlessly replaced, less so. Let us not carp about who did what, got sent off or benefited from a refereeing mistake, Wales are worthy champions. Of the chasing nations, Scotland and Ireland have a lot more to be pleased about than France and England. Scotland’s fourth place was scant reward in a season  . What must irk head coach Gregor Townsend is knowing that, with a tad more discipline, without a couple of aberrant acts, the one- and three-point losses to Wales and Ireland respectively could have been reversed and a Grand Slam claimed. They did not deserve to beat Ireland, but the chance was there, nonetheless. As with all the sides, the issue of discipline, at crucial points in games, is something Scotland must master. Their pack is now solid, and they have an array of attacking talent better and deeper than at any time in the professional era. The back three of Stuart Hogg, Sean Maitland or Darcy Graham, and Duhan van der Merwe is the equal of nearly any side in the world. France’s performances ebbed with each round and if the Covid-19 situation and postponed Scotland game affected them, they have only themselves to blame. In Antoine Dupont they have a gem and at least they were able to see several bench players prove they can handle this level of rugby. That said, the return of indiscipline and insouciance undercut France’s efforts and the glamour and style they are capable of was only sporadic. Every game involving France was worth watching and they  . Neither of their losses was overwhelming, but they did not achieve what their talent and squad depth promised. Head coach Fabien Galthie does not need to worry unduly, but nor can he be comfortable with the limited gains his side made in finishing second. England cannot honestly claim  . There are reasons, not excuses, for their poor showing – a Covid-limited squad and undercooked players being the chief issues. You then must look at Eddie Jones’ inflexibility in selection and the struggle to find a style that modifies the previously successful strategy of kicking on the front foot, as a first-choice option. Both added to their woes but there is another issue that is paramount. The fact that they conceded the same number of penalties as Italy is damning. No side can hope to win close games against top-class opposition if they cannot solve this problem and it is not new. They have been pilloried in the media and in public and cannot complain about some of the comments. I would, however, point out that the same people who now shout loudest about their decline did the same in 2018 – and look how that turned out. They have not become a bad side in one competition, but they have many issues to rectify, in an ever-shortening window, before the next World Cup."

Justin Cochrane a strong contender for England Under-21 job
","
Cochrane has previously worked at Tottenham Hotspur and coached through the England youth levels
","Jason Burt, ","
30 March 2021 • 3:12pm
","Justin Cochrane has emerged as a strong candidate should  Boothroyd’s contract expires this summer and the Football Association is considering whether it is time to make a change. The Under-21s are on the verge of exiting the European Championships having been beaten by Switzerland and Portugal, failing to register a shot on target, in what has, so far, been another dismal campaign. Their final group game is against Croatia on Wednesday with England needing a two-goal victory and help from elsewhere - otherwise they will be out. England   and the pressure on Boothroyd to go would be overwhelming. The FA may decide it is time for a change come what may. If Boothroyd leaves the task of replacing him will fall to John McDermott, the FA’s new technical director, although there is also expected to be   who was Boothroyd’s predecessor. Boothroyd has been in charge since 2016, promoted from his role with the Under-20s, and the FA will consider internal and external candidates as part of a shortlist. The highly-rated Cochrane is likely to feature prominently and is well-known to McDermott having previously worked with him at Tottenham Hotspur where he was assistant head of development (11-16) and went on to coach at Under-23 level at the Premier League club. The 39-year-old was appointed England Under-15s coach and then moved through the age groups to take charge of the Under-16s and then Under-17s. A former international with Antigua and Barbuda, London-born Cochrane started his playing career at Queens Park Rangers although he made his most appearances with Crewe Alexandra before dropping into non-league football. However the former midfielder has built a strong reputation within the FA through his coaching ability and is likely to be shortlisted as a replacement for Boothroyd. During a discussion last year on ending white privilege in football and the lack of BAME representation Southgate described Cochrane as potentially “top coach” and it appears that view is shared throughout the FA. Southgate has argued that more “forceful change” is needed. “We have some very good young black coaches coming through our development teams, Justine Cochrane is somebody who I think, within our group of national coaches, he is going to be a top coach,” Southgate said. “We also shouldn’t look just at the ex-players or high-profile players because as we know, so many of the top managers haven’t been top top international players and that route must also be open to black coaches that haven’t played at the highest level.” Even if Cochrane does not succeed Boothroyd it appears he is likely to be interviewed for the post and could be part of the new set-up for the Under-21s."
sport,,,,,"Apparently my mobile phone is quite a sophisticated gadget. It can make and receive calls, track my speed and location, allow me to manage my overdraft, and even control my central heating from anywhere in the world (this last one still amazes me on a regular basis). But for the past few months it has fulfilled a far simpler function, acting as a portal to a world that seemed so far away yet is now tantalisingly   Sunday League football. There is one particular video on my phone that my wife would file for divorce if she knew how many times I had grubbily watched it; every occasion during lockdown that I felt at my lowest, snuck into the bathroom, pulled my phone out and gave myself a visual dopamine hit. It is an 18-second clip taken last October, during that all-too-brief period we naively assumed life had returned to something resembling normality. The stage is Victoria Park, London, where two amateur football teams - one of them mine - are battling in a knockout cup tie. It is early in the second half and the ball is bouncing around on the left flank about 35 yards from goal. Suddenly, with a nonchalance earned through decades of firing Sunday League blanks and therefore having precisely zero expectations of what is about to unfold, our striker Joel controls it with his right foot and casually unleashes hell with his left. Improbably, the camera is positioned at the perfect angle directly behind him. His shot rises, dips, beats the diving goalkeeper, crashes off the crossbar and goes in. Think Papiss Cisse for Newcastle United against Chelsea in 2012. Then picture the scene as a dozen squad members (there was a hefty supporting cast that day) lose their minds on the touchline like a group of five-year-olds told to run riot in a soft-play centre. It is beautiful mayhem; pure child-like ecstasy that, for more than three dismal, dreary, depressing months of lockdown, has been missing. In recent weeks, I have been down to my local park on a few occasions and kicked a ball with a friend. It has, given the circumstances, been bliss. Pumping up the ball, lacing up the Copa Mundial boots, needlessly putting on a replica shirt, and repeatedly failing to kick the ball in the air further than 20 yards. It has been a crumb of footballing comfort in bleak times. I cannot wait to be beaten by an opposition winger again, limply challenge for a header or pass the ball straight out of play. I cannot wait to be riled by a patently incorrect offside decision. More than that, I cannot wait to play as a team. To see Radu, our chain-smoking Romanian goalkeeper who comes straight from working the night shift; Wicksy, the best canal boat-habiting amateur footballer in the south; Mario, who resolutely refuses to buy a mobile phone or computer and can only be contacted via landline. To walk out with Ben Q, who has invariably not been to bed; Faz, who retires from football on a fortnightly basis; Joe H, who can kick a ball further than the rest of us combined. The names will be different up and down the country - Faz might be Mark, Radu might be Sarah, Wicksy might be JP - but for thousands of people, this week has heralded the return of something so much bigger than simply kicking or throwing a ball. I was recently asked a hypothetical question about what professional sport I would like any children I have to play. Without a moment’s hesitation I suggested anything played as part of a team. Within my football team, ages range from 25 to 58. I have been on football tours with all of them and yet I do not know most of their partners’ names. We have a shared bond that is much more important than winning or losing. It is not the act of making a last-ditch slide tackle I miss, but what it means for everyone. That game in which Joel scored his wonder goal finished 2-2 after normal time and we ended up losing it on penalties. Despite being knocked out of the cup, defeat was irrelevant. I was not even playing that day, but it remains my favourite ever amateur football match. It got me through lockdown. Finally, we can make new memories again."
sport,,,,,"“Agueroooooo”. There are some moments in football that need little by way of explanation. Utter Martin Tyler’s simple but immortal line for that   on that sun-soaked afternoon at the Etihad Stadium and anyone with a reasonable interest in football will know instantly what you are talking about. It was, and is, the most famous goal in Premier League history and something truly extraordinary is going to have to happen to ever supplant it from that position. After a 44-year wait to be reacquainted with the championship, that goal would be cemented in Manchester City folklore whatever the circumstances. That it snatched the title away on goal difference from the club in whose shadow City had not so much lived as suffered and almost become defined by for two decades was a fairy tale that not even the most imaginative supporter could have dreamt up. Manchester United and Sir Alex Ferguson were almost breaking out into celebration at Sunderland’s Stadium of Light when Aguero received Mario Balotelli’s pass, nicked the ball past Taye Taiwo after the slightest of feints and thundered home a finish. The clock said 93:20 - a time so iconic they ended up naming a suite at the Etihad after it. You had to be inside the stadium that day to fully appreciate the noise and delirium that ensued - and the kaleidoscope of emotions among supporters, many of whom had been pouring out of the exit doors 10 minutes before Aguero pounced. I do not subscribe to the view that City would never have recovered had they blown the title that day - the owners are too rich, the project too good - but it may have set the whole thing back a couple of years, if not longer, and invited a fresh torrent of “cups for cock-ups” taunts. Had Aguero missed, it could have had other consequences, too - it might even have seen Ferguson retire that summer, 12 months before he finally bowed out. David Gill, the former United chief executive, once told me he had never seen Ferguson lower than that summer and, for a while, even he seemed unsure if the Scot was going to be able to summon the energy to return again the next season and fight to win the title back. And that was a man who had already won 12 of the things. Imagine how City would have felt? So it is totally reasonable to say Aguero provided the foundation for the success that was to follow, that he unlocked the key bequeathed by Sheikh Mansour’s largesse.  in England although, in truth, you did not have to wait until the giddy denouement of that breathless campaign to realise City had someone special in their midst. His two-goal debut against Swansea on Aug 15, 2011 was one of the finest in the competition’s history, despite only running for half an hour, and he only needed another two games to plunder his first hat-trick against a Wigan Athletic side who simply did not know what had hit them. He would end up with 12 Premier League hat-tricks - surpassing Alan Shearer’s record last year - although whether there is a lucky 13th to come between now and his departure in May remains to be seen. You sense Aguero would settle for one more big, defining goal, given that it seems unrealistic to think he is going to get a lot of minutes over the next two months after so little football in the past year. It is curious that we still know so comparatively little about a man who has spent a decade on these shores but then there is something appealingly old-fashioned about Aguero’s unfussy pursuit of goals, goals and more goals. He’s like the Argentine Paul Scholes - it’s about the game and the game only for him and if there’s a back door out of the stadium to make a quick getaway and escape the media throngs then rest assured he will find it. The two would probably get on well. Aguero has never sought to encourage the sort of mystique that formed around the flamboyant Eric Cantona. He never courted controversy like Luis Suarez. He has not had the profile of Thierry Henry, who gave us “va-va-voom” on and off the pitch. He never declared an ambition to become the world’s greatest footballer, like Cristiano Ronaldo, even if, for a while, his old manager at City, Manuel Pellegrini, was convinced Aguero was the planet’s best after the Portuguese and Lionel Messi. Hell, he does not even have a trademark goal celebration. Even Shearer, who celebrated Blackburn’s title triumph in 1995 by creosoting his fence, had one of those. Indeed, one of the most revealing and touching parts of Amazon’s All Or Nothing documentary charting City’s 2017-18 title-winning season was when the cameras went into Aguero’s home and found a man living a rather lonely existence. But for a monthly visit from his son Benjamin, or the occasional hang out with Nicolas Otamendi or David De Gea, Aguero admitted he spent a lot of his spare time watching mafia and action films - just not horror movies that might scare a man living on his own. Part of you just wanted to wrap him up and bring him home in that moment. Perhaps they are some of the factors behind why some may hesitate to call Aguero the Premier League’s best ever striker, and maybe that would be a step too far, but he has more goals in the competition than any overseas player and the best goals-per-minute ratio of anyone. And, as with David Silva and Vincent Kompany, two other City greats who, like Aguero, will soon be immortalised in statues outside the Etihad, the Argentine will not be easily replaced, off the field let alone on it. That said, you wondered for a while if Pep Guardiola was completely sold at first. Aguero, like Carlos Tevez before him, was one of those strikers who would hold back in training, saving himself for matchday, and for a character like Guardiola that was not always easy to accept. But the Catalan came to appreciate and admire Aguero in a way everyone else did and, with the arrival of Gabriel Jesus, provided the stimulus that would help lift the Argentine’s level again. There have been four Premier League titles, one FA Cup and five League Cups and there could be another batch of silverware to follow over the final instalment of his City career. Perhaps the club will yet reach the Champions League final and Aguero will come off the bench to clinch the winner in Istanbul on May 29. Maybe, just maybe, there is another ‘Aguerooooo’ moment to come. It would certainly be a fitting bookend. With 181 Premier League goals, Sergio Aguero sits fourth in the all-time list behind Alan Shearer (260), Wayne Rooney (208) and Andy Cole (187). And you wouldn’t bet against him moving past Cole in Manchester City’s final eight league games of the season. When the 33 year-old departs the Etihad after their last game against Everton, the debate will rage over the Argentine hitman’s place among the all-time greats. Arguably the one downside for Aguero to playing alongside the likes of Vincent Kompany, Yaya Toure, David Silva and Kevin de Bruyne has been he’s never been the outright main man at City. In the five seasons between 2014 and 2019, Aguero scored more than 20 goals each time but only in the final two was he named in the PFA Team of the Year. He never won the PFA, FWA and Premier League Player of the Year awards and it all leads to the feeling that despite his efficiency in front of goal, blistering speed, power at his peak and uncanny ability to deliver in the biggest moments, he is not truly valued outside of the blue half of Manchester. Let’s start with his record compared to his biggest rival for the title of best foreign striker - Thierry Henry. Henry always considered himself more of a facilitator than a pure out-and-out striker. Yet his goals-per-match record and shooting accuracy are higher than Aguero. Aguero will finish with more goals but has played in more games and over a longer period than Henry. Heading was never a strength of Henry's but despite being only 5ft 8in, Aguero has an impressive 18 goals with his head compared to just six for the former Arsenal player. Goals per game is arguably the statistic that provides the clearest illustration of how good a striker is. The top eight strikers in this list have all scored at least 110 league goals and made over 200 appearances. Henry is joint-top with Tottenham's Harry Kane on 0.68. Aguero is on his own in third with 0.67. If Aguero was quicker to get up to speed after injury lay-offs it is probable he would have been above Henry and Kane. Aguero's record works out at 109 minutes per goal with a shooting accuracy of 53.69 per cent. In comparison, Kane is currently 123mins and 58.21 respectively. Aguero has 128 goals with his right foot, 34 with his left, 27 from the penalty spot, 160 inside the box and 21 outside the 18-yard area.  It is a testament to Aguero's enduring quality that he adapted his game when Pep Guardiola became manager in 2016 and remained first choice despite competition from Gabriel Jesus. Another major indicator of a striker's prolific side is the number of hat-tricks accrued and this is where Aguero stands out clearly. With 12 trebles to his name, he is ahead by one of Shearer and four clear of Kane, who has eight. Shearer had held the record for a decade before Aguero overtook him with three goals in the 6-1 thrashing of Aston Villa in January 2020. The biggest threat to Aguero's record is Kane, who, provided he stays in England, will certainly run him close. Aguero can also boast scoring four goals in a game on two occasions and five in a 6-1 win over Newcastle in October 2015. Nine of Aguero's hat-tricks have come at the Etihad and six were scored when City had put the same number past their opponent. Invariably, when City battered the opposition, Aguero was there doing most of the damage. As it stands, Aguero is on 181 goals. If he's fit and selected by Guardiola, Aguero is capable of surpassing Cole for third place, especially with games against Crystal Palace, Newcastle and Brighton to come. Aguero has a combined 20 goals against those three teams with a staggering 15 coming against Newcastle.  Among foreign players, Aguero is at the top of the tree with nobody likely to pass him for the foreseeable future. Mohamed Salah (92) and Sadio Mane (91) are the closest active Premier League players to Aguero while Romelu Lukaku (113) could chase him down if he returns to English football in the near future. Aguero's most memorable goal will forever be his stoppage-time strike against QPR which is probably the most important in Premier League history. If he fails to scores, does City's quest for domination get derailed? On the City website, there is a 30-minute compilation of 180 of Aguero's 181 league goals. He started with a brace against Swansea and rarely slowed down, scoring every type of goal you can think of. Quite simply, Aguero has been the deadliest marksmen in Premier League history. "
sport,,,,,"The memories will be flowing tomorrow. It may be 48 years on, but the clown of a goalkeeper, the fruitless pressure, the era-ending aftermath, will all be recalled at length. Yes, England are playing Poland once again in a World Cup qualifier. And never mind that in the 15 meetings since that fateful 1-1 draw, England have not lost to them. Because of that traumatic October evening at Wembley in 1973, the Poles have invariably been cast as the Three Lions’ bogey team. That is what failure does for football fans: it lingers in the collective memory as prominently as victory. But for all the forensic scrutiny of Jan Tomaszewski’s goalkeeping prowess, or Kevin Hector’s last-minute header being hacked off the line, or Norman Hunter’s face as he trooped off the pitch at the final whistle, there is something about that 1973 match that has been largely forgotten in the modern era: back then, there was proper jeopardy involved in World Cup qualification. Over the years since, for the larger footballing nations, the process has become so straightforward as to be almost foolproof. Almost foolproof: as Holland and Italy in 2018, not to mention Graham Taylor’s England in 1994, proved, even a system established to be a ceremonial invitation can be compromised by incompetence. But, back in 1973, getting to the finals was a proper challenge. Uefa’s qualification Group Five consisted of just three teams: England, Wales and Poland. Only the winner progressed; there were no play-offs, no safety net, second place was an irrelevance. It was all or nothing, win or bust. It meant every match mattered, every match had consequence. What is more, there were not very many of them. Alf Ramsey only had to negotiate four games spread across a year; this month,  . Back then, there was value in rarity. And while many a football fan will regard tomorrow’s encounter as a pointless interruption to their club’s league campaign, in 1973 the whole nation held its breath (apart from those of Scottish inclination who were barely able to suppress their laughter). The trepidation was understandable: after losing away in Poland and drawing at home with Wales, England’s chances as they approached their final fixture were already teetering on the brink. There was a real chance that, for the first time since they had condescended to participate, England might not be going to a World Cup. Four years later, it was even more tricky. This time in a four-team group, to get to Argentina, England had to better Italy. They ended up with the same number of points, but failed to head west on goal difference. Over the years since, driven by a Fifa always keen to squeeze its assets until the pips squeak, the finals have been expanded (in 2018 Uefa sent 14 national teams to Russia, in 1974 it was but nine) and the process of getting there eased to ensure the countries delivering big television audiences are as good as certain to be involved. But making it easier has significant repercussions, not least on the meaning of a competition. Since the last-gasp goalless draw in Rome that ensured participation in France 1998, England’s qualification to subsequent World Cups has been almost entirely bereft of drama, a procession of gimmes that have lingered in the collective memory about as long as a goldfish’s circuit of their bowl sticks in theirs. All rarity value has been expunged. Worse, the system has done little to hone the team in preparation for the finals themselves. Ahead of the 2010 tournament, for instance, England strolled through, winning nine of their 10 qualifiers, before stinking out the finals. After knocking out England in 1973, in contrast, a battle-hardened Poland made it to the semi-final of the tournament the following summer, even beating Brazil in the third place play-off. It was their finest World Cup performance. So, when we look back at what happened that fateful October night at Wembley 48 years ago, the nostalgia is infused with a memory of a time when such encounters carried weight. Tomorrow, in truth, is just another game. "

Gareth Southgate's 43 England debuts: triumphs, disasters, future Pointless answers
","
England have changed dramatically since 2016, but how many new players have made a difference?
","Thom Gibbs, ","
30 March 2021 • 12:28pm
","Roy Hodgson’s final  line-up is a team from a different time. His starting XI for the defeat to Iceland at Euro 2016 was as follows: Joe Hart; Kyle Walker, Gary Cahill, Chris Smalling, Danny Rose; Dele Alli, Eric Dier, Wayne Rooney; Daniel Sturridge, Harry Kane, Raheem Sterling. Despite Gareth Southgate’s nicest revolution ever, all of those players were in the matchday   for his first game against Malta, apart from injury absentees Kane and Sterling.  Now it’s just those two who are likely candidates to start against Croatia on 13 June, an indication of just how much has changed for England under Southgate. He has given debuts to 43 players since taking the job, with most of his experimentation taking place at centre back and in attacking midfield: There is arguably a lack of good options for the former, necessitating some trial and error. In the latter position he has more than he knows what to do with. The England manager has stressed that it should be tough to earn an England cap, but even tougher to lose your place in the squad if you perform well. His loyalty to his World Cup cohort has been clear, sticking with some despite uneven club form.  The boys of '18 lead the way for most caps by Southgate’s debutants, but it’s the quartet of Sancho, Mount, Rice and Chilwell below them which demonstrate how well the new intake has been blooded. How well have Southgate’s picks worked out? We have divided the debutants into five categories, and speculated about who could be added to the list next. only made his debut last year and has just five appearances to date, but barring a dramatic loss of form or   he will have a place in the England squad for as long as he wants it. Pep Guardiola brought the midfielder into the limelight with extreme care and Southgate has played his part too. Should be a mainstay for years to come.  and  were two of the emerging stars from the suddenly lovable England team of 2018. Maguire has recovered from a shaky start to this season and looks a likely pick at centre back for the medium term. With 31 caps under Southgate, no debutant has played more for his manager. Pickford’s status as number one is less assured but Southgate rewards performances for England above all, and the Everton keeper’s domestic ricks have been largely absent when playing for his country.  Southgate gave 10 players their first chance for England in 2018, and none of that group have won as many caps  , with 18 to date. He is pushing hard for a place in the team, and has the look of a useful surprise-start option when others have tired for the final Euros group game.  and   made their debuts six months apart as recently as 2019, both could start in the first game at the Euros. Did you know they’re good friends? Someone should write an article...  was Southgate’s first debutant, he started against Malta in 2016 and was a key player during the World Cup. Went quiet for Manchester United in the years that followed but has impressed at West Ham and Southgate has stuck by his man.   is another beneficiary of the manager’s loyalty. Has recovered his form at Atletico Madrid after a tricky end to his time at Spurs, and that’s before mentioning his betting ban. Superb at the World Cup, and looks to have a guaranteed place in the Euros squad.  On the other flank   is in with a shout of starting at left-back. Has played more than 1,000 minutes since his debut against Switzerland in 2018, only five players have more.  single-handedly makes Aston Villa appointment television but it may not be enough to make Southgate’s starting XI. Clamour from Birmingham alone should secure his space in the squad, but one of the highly talented attacking coterie is going to end up heartbroken. Would be harsh on , but perhaps his youth may be the deciding factor when it comes to the tricky point of finalising a 23 for the Euros? Slightly surprisingly  is the joint top-scorer among Southgate’s debutants with four. Two came against San Marino last week. Mason Mount and Jesse Lingard share his top spot  made his debut in pre-World Cup warm-up against Costa Rica,  ’s came in November against Ireland. They are the likely back-ups to Pickford barring injury. ’s injury means he is unlikely to feature again for England until September’s resumption of World Cup qualifiers.   and   are able deputies at centre back in his absence.   is very good at free kicks.  Several here who are in contention for the Euros squad, and certainly the World Cup campaign that follows.   has been a steady presence in midfield during his six caps to date and has the class to stake a claim.  has a good chance of starting at right-back, the biggest toss-up position in Southgate’s starting XI.  is ahead of  in the current pecking order, both highly talented players who unfortunately may be watching this summer’s football on TV with the rest of us. Leicester’s   has not been used since against Wales in October last year but may get another go after the Euros. Chelsea centre back   is stuck on one cap for now, but his current loan spell at AC Milan makes him an intriguing option at centre back for the future.  Jury decidedly out on the two debutants from last week’s game against San Marino, although you’d probably predict a brighter England future for third-youngest debutant   than Aston Villa’s man in form  .    seems increasingly likely to miss out on the squad this summer, in what you would hope is an odd footnote in an otherwise outstanding career. Southgate picked him early, taking him to the World Cup, so there is no suggestion he doesn’t fancy him. The rest may do him good.   and   are in the dreaded mid-twenties of any ranking of potential England squads. Both solid options, both likely to miss the cut for the Euros.  ’s stock has fallen this season after flourishing in the optimistic youth revolution days of early-Lampard as Chelsea manager.   is a rare bright spot for Newcastle and has four caps under Southgate, but has not featured since 2019.  and   have had senior minutes, but both are currently with the Under-21s at their European Championships. Southgate rates   but has not used him since 2018. Has impressed during Fulham’s semi-renaissance but may need to leave Chelsea permanently this summer to stake a stronger claim for the national team.    and   fit the category of fans’ favourites who ‘should play for England’ but find themselves behind in respective positional pecking orders. Both have a cap each, both in the weird Wayne Rooney farewell game of November 2018 against the USA. Tough to see either adding to that collection soon. One cap and just one minute of action in an England shirt to date for  , he came on in injury time during the dramatic Nations League win over Spain at Wembley. Watford midfielder hasn’t featured since, and after one cap each nor have  ,  ,  , and  .  has played for Southgate three times, but not since Lithuania in October 2017. Twice-capped   is an excellent future pick for players capped under Southgate should it ever come up as a round on Pointless.  seemed close to a call-up before this international break and will surely get his chance after the Euros if he maintains his current form with Leeds. Seems surprising that   has yet to feature for the senior team. He’s 23 so time is on his side, the fact England could field an entire XI of decent right-backs is less positive news. Leicester’s  could be part of that team, his ability to do a job on the other side could make him a useful squad member. Brighton's  fits a team in search of ball-playing central defenders and could be a more than capable understudy to John Stones.  West Brom keeper   is in the current squad and yet to get on the pitch. That is unlikely to change until after the Euros barring an unlikely series of goalkeeper injury disasters. Don’t let Nick Pope even look at a  . Among the England Under 21 squad currently failing to cover itself in glory in Slovenia   looks a safe bet for a call-up within the next year. He has played at England for every level since U16, and that sort of impeccable pathway-adherence seems likely to work in his favour. Crystal Palace’s   has huge potential but must join a long queue of gifted attacking players.  We are legally obliged to mention that Barcelona were interested in   of Norwich, promotion into the Premier League beckons for him and he gives Southgate yet another option at right-back. Liverpool’s   and Tottenham’s   also have the look of future call-ups.  Getting younger still, one Englishman playing abroad who may be worth remembering is winger   at Juventus. A Chelsea youth product showing enormous promise who was born in the year 2003. Terrifying. "

The proposal threatening to condemn London's homes to darkness
","
A consultation is currently underway which could reduce the amount of light builders must allow into newly constructed properties
",Ben Gartside,"
28 March 2021 • 6:00pm
","After a year of rolling lockdowns and shuttered offices, light and airy housing has never been more important to Britain’s legions of city dwellers. Alongside the old staples of a lively local high street, good pub and short commute, a new box has been added to typical home-hunter’s checklist – how much sun their property lets in. But the demand for natural light is threatening to put occupiers at odds with developers at a time when space is at a premium and   is seen as essential to solve the country’s housing crisis. In London, a consultation launched by mayor Sadiq Khan includes a possible reduction in a key measure of how much light builders must allow into their properties, the so-called vertical sky component. “There’s a bit of a battle going on,” says lighting consultant Paul Littlefair. “Obviously, you have developers who want to build bigger and bigger and have buildings that restrict more light. And obviously from a point of view of providing housing in London, you need all this extra housing. “But on the other hand, [you have] existing residents who need daylight and want to retain the daylight they currently have.” The vertical sky component calculates the angle of light entering through a window and is meant to prevent dingy houses from getting built. It is part of planning code and must be taken into account by developers along with other environmental measures. Campaigners argue the changes proposed in the consultation could condemn thousands of families to perpetual semi-darkness. They say that the changes will significantly cut how much light enters individual rooms and point out that being cut off from the sun can harm occupiers’ physical and mental health. “The links between daylight and both physical and mental health are very well established,” says planning activist George Turner. “After a year of being locked down in our homes, I think we can all appreciate the importance of having access to adequate daylight. “Daylight standards do not stop new development, they stop bad development. There is no reason why competent architects can’t design new buildings that protect the living conditions of neighbours.” The row over daylight is already causing a headache for ministers. Housing Secretary Robert Jenrick is poised to rule on a £500m project at 8 Albert Embankment, a London Fire Brigade site being developed into 443 homes which builder U+I says will create 1,200 new jobs. Researchers at the Building Research Establishment (BRE) have warned that 424 properties would fall below its recommended daylight standards as new buildings cut off the views from existing ones, including accommodation for disabled people in the ground floor of a nearby block of flats, and Turner is leading a bid to protect neighbours’ rights. A spokesman for U+I defended the development, saying the benefits outweighed the costs. He said: “As with all tall buildings in central London there will always be some impact, particularly in areas like this where local and regional planning policy supports high density development. “With a slender diamond shaped form, the taller elements of our proposals have been specifically designed to minimise any impact on neighbouring properties, and as a result the level of daylight retained would be considered normal in other central London areas. “This ultimately needs to be balanced against the huge number of public benefits that this scheme will deliver, including a modern new fire station [and] a permanent home for the London Fire Brigade Museum. More than 40pc of the properties being built will be affordable, the spokesman said. Despite the battle coming to a head over Albert Embankment, the debate is not a new one. The BRE has previously raised concerns about a host of other major projects including Wood Wharf on the Isle of Dogs, part of a rejuvenation of an area previously owned by British Waterways. Planning was approved in 2014 by Boris Johnson when he was mayor of London, despite BRE objections during the initial planning stage which found that 993 of 2,153 surrounding windows would fall below BRE thresholds for light levels if it went ahead. Other planned projects in the area had similar issues. Canary Wharf’s Heron Quay West caused 730 individual breaches of the BRE tests, while the proposed Columbus tower left 60pc of surrounding homes to fall below the minimum level for new buildings. Experts such as Littlefair admit there is increasingly a trade-off between protecting existing homes’ access to daylight and solving London’s housing crisis. As businesses across the capital embrace flexible working, that challenge is only going to grow."

Custom House hotel makeover to reignite deal controversy
","
The development is likely to bring up concerns over the original agreement, which was signed when Tony Blair was prime minister
",Adam Luck,"
28 March 2021 • 8:00pm
","One of the Government’s most famous buildings is to be turned into a plush London hotel in a £180m project – without a penny of any profit going to the taxpayer. Custom House – a Grade I listed Georgian building that dominates the north bank of the Thames in central London – is set to be converted by Guernsey-based  , which bought the freeholds and historic leaseholds of 132 HMRC offices for £370m in 2001 in a 20-year private finance initiative deal. The development is likely to reignite controversy over the original deal, signed when Tony Blair was prime minister. There was fury when it emerged the property portfolio had been transferred to Bermuda. A sale and leaseback agreement under which Mapeley provided serviced government offices means HMRC has since paid the firm more than £3.5bn. Mapeley is also facing questions about the details of its proposal for Custom House, for which the firm agreed a 175-year lease at a peppercorn rent. The application, which is due to come before a City of London Corporation committee later this year, sets out plans to convert the neo-classical building into a 204-bedroom hotel with two rooftop pavilions. The historic 180ft Long Room where officials once processed paperwork for customs duties will be refurbished. Conservation charity the Georgian Group opposes the plans and said they would harm the significance of the building. Mapeley subsidiary Cannon Capital Developments has devised other ambitious property developments in former government offices across the country, including in Edinburgh, Manchester, Leicester, Milton Keynes and Swansea. Mapeley’s other historic gems include The Mount, a Grade II listed property in Shrewsbury which is the birthplace of Charles Darwin, and Custom House in Belfast which was sold to an investment firm last year."
sport,,,,,"This winter has proved England are a very entertaining team to watch because you are never sure what is going to happen next. What I look for in sport is skill, drama and controversy. We had all three in India. England are like the Newcastle team under Kevin Keegan. It is all or nothing. This India tour has been a good example. You could not take your eyes off the Tests, and  . If you want to be a great team then you have to be more resilient and determined. It is a little boring, but having said that, I would happily buy a season ticket to watch this lot. In Test cricket, they lose matches because they have phases when they do silly things. They beat Sri Lanka 2-0 but could have lost the second match. They beat India in the first Test, but then never looked like winning for the rest of the series. They lost to West Indies last summer but fought their way back and should have lost to Pakistan at Old Trafford, but pulled off a miracle victory. So, yes, I would buy a season ticket to watch them. England won nine out of 11 tosses in India, but lost all three series. My overriding feeling is that losing three series was OK. It should not be damaging in the long term because it will be a while before these players have to play on spinning snake pits again, if ever. Ultimately, when they play New Zealand at Lord’s on June 2 in the first Test of the summer, it will be like playing a different sport because conditions will be so different, so perhaps we should not read too much into this winter. It was just disappointing from my point of view that they did not put more emphasis on the four Tests. That is my biggest concern for the future of Test cricket. England play a dynamic style in one-day cricket that is brilliant to watch and exciting. Even though they were down and out,   in the final one-dayer to give themselves a sniff. Sadly that was what was required earlier on. I do not want England to become a one-trick pony always on the charge because teams like that get found out. I thought the 50-over team was more balanced with the right-hander Liam Livingstone in the middle order. Moeen Ali made the team better as well. We know England have massive depth and are fearless with the bat, but their bowling is a concern. Reece Topley is a bowler I want to see more of. He offers a bit of a difference. They have to find a replacement for Liam Plunkett to take wickets in the middle overs and perhaps could look at Wood coming back on a bit earlier to make breakthroughs. We did not learn much about the Test team. James Anderson proved he is still fantastic, Jofra Archer is resting now and the question is can he play five out of seven Tests in the summer? I think he needs that, and so does the team. The most disappointing aspect of the winter was that England did not improve with the bat as the Test series wore on, if anything they got worse. For a while now, once they have a bad Test match overseas against a good team they go on a downward spiral. It happened on the last two Ashes and India tours. That is a concern because it could happen again in Australia later this year if they are not careful. At home, they have a habit of coming back, but overseas losing seems to affect them more. They will soon put things right in the English summer, but we have to guard against getting too carried away and thinking they are a great team if they win two or three Tests in a row. This Test side is a long way short of being great. They are behind India, who have a chance of beating them over five Tests this summer if they have the right attitude. When I look at India it baffles me how they are not the absolutely dominant side in every format. They should be the powerhouse of world cricket on the field, battering everybody. They have every single aspect of the game covered but fielded like clubbies in the last one-dayer. It was National League standard. If they can get that aspect right and continue with the aggressive batting then they will be unstoppable in two years’ time at the next 50-over World Cup. They have bowlers who will take wickets in India, a Test team that can travel and win. They have players who can face quick bowling and the moving ball. They have quick bowlers, skillful spinners, swing bowlers and exciting batsmen. They have depth as well. They should be head and shoulders above everyone else."

Mass Covid testing of lorry drivers entering UK delayed until April 6

Hauliers get more than a week to prepare for mandatory lateral flow testing of any driver who spends over 48 hours in Britain

","The mass coronavirus testing of   is to be delayed until Tuesday, April 6, in an attempt to minimise the risk of disruption to food and other supplies. Hauliers are to be given more than a week to prepare for the mandatory lateral flow testing of any driver who spends more than 48 hours in Britain to deliver their goods. The move, to be announced by the Government on Sunday, is designed to prevent the importation of   from Europe and  , where up to one in 10 cases have been linked to the  . It came as France recorded   on Friday, with the number of deaths increasing by 897 to 94,275. The country's surging rates are likely to intensify calls among scientists and from within Government for further travel restrictions to be imposed on arrivals from France within days. Ministers believe the week's preparation, allowing the haulier testing to be done at more than 40 sites in the UK rather than at the border, as well as the exemption for those who can deliver and leave within 48 hours, will limit disruption and delays that could cause shortages of food and other vital supplies. However, the concessions to keep trade running are likely to lead to criticism that the scheme will be be open to abuse and could still pose a risk as lorry drivers who spend less than 48 hours in the UK will not be tested and could still come into contact with people despite social distancing rules. The delay until April 6 will mean some 40,000 lorries will arrive in the UK before testing begins. Yvette Cooper, the Labour chair of the home affairs committee, said: ""It is inexplicable that a year on from the start of the pandemic, the Government is still delaying border measures. Speed matters when combating Covid. ""Already we’ve had cases of the South Africa variant arrive here from Europe and thousands of hauliers arrive in the UK each week, doing their vital job, so they should be tested. ""We're all desperate to protect the vaccine programme and keep   on track so things can open up. So we can't let new variants derail that because of lack of basic testing."" Under the plans –   – all lorry drivers staying longer than two days will be required to have a Covid test within 48 hours and then every 72 hours. This would mean three tests on days two, five, and eight, at one of the 39 testing sites across the UK. They will be expected to complete locator forms so that Border Force officials will be able to check if they have overstayed, and there will be fines of up to £2,000 if they fail to undergo the tests. The rules apply to all lorry drivers, UK and non-UK, bringing loads from any country apart from Ireland.  The testing has been approved before ministers next week review whether to add France to  , which would require travellers to undergo   at a cost of £1,750 per person. On Friday night, Whitehall sources stressed that, despite surging case rates in France, no changes to the ""red list"" were expected imminently. One pointed out that, while officials were concerned about the risk of importing variants, there was little evidence to suggest this was happening currently. Rod McKenzie, of the Road Haulage Association, said: ""We don't sense it will have a big impact on logistics. They are using the existing infrastructure and the drivers themselves are used to testing on the outbound journey to France and that is now ending."" The RHA has advised drivers to only leave the cab for essential purposes, such as eating and washing, and to use hand sanitiser each time they enter and leave the cab. "

How to cure the bane of slow play in golf
","
From banning green books to rolling back the ball, Telegraph Sport looks at some potential solutions
",Daniel Zeqiri,"
30 March 2021 • 12:26pm
","The scourge of slow play is back on golf's agenda after a The sloth-like pace of Billy Horschel and Scottie Scheffler in the final attracted widespread criticism from figures such as Colin Montgomerie, Catriona Matthew and Sky Sports commentator Ewen Murray.  The rise of Bryson DeChambeau, , has also prompted discussions about pace of play with the American's   At the 2019 Masters, DeChambeau was roundly condemned for taking more than two minutes to line up an 11-foot putt.  DeChambeau's scientific 'vector putting' method also makes use of green books, which record every undulation and borrow on each green in great detail, and these guides are now commonplace on Tour and frequently blamed for slow play.  So what can be done to address the problem? Telegraph Sport offers some potential solutions.  It's a familiar concept from various spheres of life: if you want to discourage patterns of behaviour then offer a serious deterrent.  Fans grew frustrated with the PGA Tour's reluctance to issue stroke-penalties for slow play, relying too much on a system of warnings and fines. Given the average PGA Tour player has a figure resembling a telephone number in their bank account, financial punishments are unlikely to cause much concern.  In fairness, the PGA Tour did announce a new, more stringent pace-of-play policy at the start of 2020. This involved keeping an unpublished list of its slowest players based on timings from data provider ShotLink. Players go on and off the list based on a 10-tournament rolling period and are expected to meet a 60-second average for all shots. If they take more than this, they can be 'put on the clock' independently from their rest of their playing group.  They also introduced the concept of an Excessive Shot Time, to be issued if any player takes more than two minutes to hit a shot without good reason. If a player does this twice within the same tournament, officials have the option to issue a one-stroke penalty. Previously, players had a clean slate at the start of each round, now they are judged across a tournament.  As ever, there are those who would like to see Tour officials reach for punitive measures more readily. ShotLink data also means they can be forensic and indiscriminate in their application of the rules, just as technology has enabled in other sports. No more complaining about a capricious rules official: if the clock says you were too slow, then there's no debate to be had.  In 2019, there was a change in the rules to prevent caddies from lining their player up on the greens. The reasoning was that alignment - a player's ability to align his body and feet with the target - was a fundamental golfing skill. Quite right too, although even this straightforward change brought teething problems with Haotong Li issued a harsh two-stroke penalty in Dubai when his caddie appeared to walk away before he took his stance.  There is an argument that reading greens is also an integral part of the game and a skill in itself. While players will occasionally 'call in' their caddie to help them read the break of a putt, they will pride themselves on their ability to read greens. It is part of what separates great putters from the merely good. Any player who backed themselves to be an above average green-reader would welcome the guides being outlawed.  The counter-argument is that these books are for players to consult on their walk to the green after their approach shot. As Phil Mickelson tweeted in 2019: ""The greens book allows me to do 80% of my read before I even get to the green. For anyone to say they slow up play is flat out idiotic.""  Unfortunately, anyone who watches the PGA Tour with any regularity will see with their own eyes that not every player uses green books this way. There will be no green books at the Masters, where they are banned by the green jacket brigade in charge of Augusta National.  The PGA of America in February announced it would permit the use of laser distance-measuring devices for longer shots in its three professional major championships - PGA Championship, KPMG Women’s PGA Championship and KitchenAid Senior PGA Championship - starting this year. The idea being that pace of play will improve if caddies no longer have to pace off distances from their nearest sprinkler head and suchlike.  “We’re always interested in methods that may help improve the flow of play during our Championships,” said Jim Richerson, president of the PGA of America.  Another of golf's hot topics: should the game's guardians intervene to stop distance getting out of control?  At first glance, you might think launching the ball a country mile thanks to advantageous golf balls and trampoline-like club faces would help players get round quicker. The problem is that in order to cope with golf's power revolution and stay relevant as tournaments venues, courses are being stretched out and tricked up.   It is now not uncommon for course routing to feature walks of 100 yards from green to the next tee, to pieces of land reclaimed from neighbouring properties and even the other side of roads. This is unsustainable, with the environmental impact of golf likely to come under increasing scrutiny in the coming decades.  Another response to prodigious distances has been setting up courses with juiced-up rough and glassy greens to prevent the scoring from going too low. From searching for lost balls to reading greens, these are also factors in slowing the game down. Almost every player on Tour can now reach par fives in two shots and take on driveable par fours, and therefore must wait for the green to clear.  (As an aside: this remains an issue at the amateur level. How many times have you played behind someone who waits five minutes for the green to clear on a par-five, three-wood in hand, only to proceed to top one straight along the ground? If you haven't played behind that person, then it's probably you.)  If you gained a reputation at your golf club for being a slow coach you might find it hard to find a playing partner at the weekends.  While being completely ostracised is not an option at the professional level, it is not unreasonable to suggest players could do a better job of policing things between themselves. Players value the approval of their peers, and everyone has experienced that criticism from a contemporary cuts the deepest. Unfortunately, a slightly saccharine culture prevails where nobody wants to speak out of turn. Brooks Koepka accepted, of course.  “I just don’t understand how it takes a minute and 20 seconds, a minute and 15 to hit a golf ball; it’s not that hard,” Koepka told a Golf Monthly podcast in 2019. ""It’s always between two clubs; there’s a miss short, there’s a miss long. It really drives me nuts especially when it’s a long hitter because you know you’ve got two other guys or at least one guy that’s hitting before you so you can do all your calculations; you should have your numbers.""  More players speaking their minds and putting heat on the tortoises in the field would not necessarily be a bad thing.  It would be simplistic and disproportionate to lay the blame at DeChambeau's door, but we are in a period when a surgical, scientific approach to the game seems to be paying dividends. Players follow trends, and amateurs follow the pros, but these things go in cycles.  While data analytics is not going anywhere as an important tool across sport, some sports psychologists warn about the dangers of paralysis by analysis. They do not want players to rush, but do encourage their pupils to play on instinct and play to the target in front of them with an uncluttered mind. Reconnecting a player with the unthinking, spontaneous play of childhood is a popular psychology lesson, trying to get them to approach golf creatively rather than being weighed down by swing mechanics.  One of the tour's faster players - Rory McIlroy perhaps? - winning majors again could see more players follow suit, at all levels. The majority of amateur golfers are dedicated followers of fashion. "

Energy customers to get automatic credit refunds in regulator plans
","
The proposals follow concerns from Ofgem firms were using customer money to fund 'otherwise unsustainable business practices' 
","Sam Meadows, ","
17 March 2021 • 6:00am
","Households would be automatically refunded any overpayments on energy bills in plans tabled by the regulator to end companies using customers’ money incorrectly. Under the current system, those who   by direct debit pay a fixed amount each month, typically overpaying in the summer months when usage is low in order to build up credit which can be drawn on throughout the winter. However, this can lead to companies holding extra cash at the end of the year and Ofgem, the industry regulator, estimated in 2018 that as much as £1.4bn was being held in surplus credit balances. The new process, which is now being consulted on, would mean suppliers would be required to refund any outstanding credit each year on the 12 month anniversary of the account being opened. Some firms already do this, but Ofgem said that in the majority of cases the onus is on the customer to claim back any extra cash. Jonathan Brearley, chief executive of Ofgem, said: “These new proposals would ensure that suppliers are not holding onto more of customers’ money than absolutely necessary, potentially returning millions of pounds of customers’ money.   “This is an important step in making the retail energy market fairer for consumers at a time when many are facing financial hardship.”  Ofgem said it is concerned that some suppliers may use customers' surplus credit balances to fund “otherwise unsustainable business practices”.  These could include relying on cash reserves to offer artificially low tariffs in the hope of quickly gaining new customers, but this comes with a risk that the company will collapse. More than 20 suppliers  , with the regulator appointing a new supplier to take over the supply of the affected customers.  However, the new firm must also take on responsibility for paying outstanding credit and can   from an industry levy. Ofgem said that 79 per cent of funds claimed from this pot were to cover credit balances. If adopted, the new system would come into force next year.  A spokesman for Energy UK, the industry trade body, said: “Paying by direct debit helps customers budget by ensuring they pay a regular amount each month even though their actual energy usage varies significantly over the year.  “Some suppliers already refund credit balances automatically so we now need to look in detail at Ofgem’s proposals.  “We look forward to working with them and our members to find an industry-wide best practice approach that supports customers and works for suppliers.” Peter Earl, head of energy at switching website Comparethemarket.com, said: “Energy companies managing credit balances has long been a matter of confusion and complexity for households.  “Although there is often a focus on customers who are in debt to their supplier, these proposals to return credit balances in a timely manner should be welcomed, especially given the burden the past year has placed on people’s finances.” Richard Neudegg, head of regulation at Uswitch.com, said: “A certain amount of energy credit can be a useful cushion for consumers during the winter months, as it can soften the blow of bills spiking if they are using their heating more at a particular time.  “However, if a customer’s monthly bill is higher than it should be or the consumption is much less than expected, their supplier could be potentially hoarding hundreds of pounds of their money.” He said that, even though the new rules will not come into force until next year, people currently in credit with their supplier may be able to claim a refund."

The Secret Science of Sewage may turn you green… in a good way

If you could stomach it, the BBC science programme investigating how sewage is the new superpower wasn't a complete waste of time
","Anita Singh, ","

","We’re at the sewage works and presenter Zoe Laughlin has just declared that it’s “time for a poo”. She’s opening a tub, surely it’s not going to contain… oh, thank goodness, it’s a poo substitute. Made from soya bean paste, which apparently is “industry standard for simulating turds in the toilet”. Well, you learn something new every day. If you’re about to stop reading in disgust then I don’t imagine you sat through   (BBC Two). I can’t blame you and neither can the show’s main host, Dr George McGavin, because as he explained: the sight and smell of human waste is “something we’re hard-wired to avoid”. We’re also programmed, as adults, to consider all this poo talk to be the preserve of five-year-old boys. And yet, if you had watched it, you might have found this Horizon film to be pretty interesting. It showed us how a sewage works operates – this one on the outskirts of Birmingham – but also explored ways in which all this waste could be harnessed for treating disease and charging your mobile phone. If surveys on social media are to be believed, an inordinate amount of children were taken on school trips to the local sewage works. Let’s hope all the visits were enlivened by the presence of an employee like the one who appeared here to describe the particular delights of his job, including administering a machine that sieves out large bits of matter from the river of raw sewage: “When you open it up and see a dead rat hanging by its tail, it’s still a bit of a shocker.” Ok, enough of the grim stuff. The mobile phone powered by pee was a fascinating idea, using the live bacteria in urine to generate electricity. The professor responsible for the project believes it could be scaled up and included in the fabric of houses. McGavin described it as “a ubiquitous and never-ending” fuel source. Other uses for the stuff found in  our sewage was mooted: powering cars, killing off deadly superbugs.  A woman turned up whose job was described as “sludge scientist”.  When did this programme get too much for me? It may have been when they discussed the “spicy top-notes” you could smell at the plant, or when they yelped with delight at the sight of micro-organisms – blown up on a screen to look like monsters – eating tiny particles of… well, you can guess. But fair play to the BBC for serving up an unpalatable subject as part of its science output."

Carbon kitemarks to help shoppers make green choice
","
Move forms part of government drive to cut UK’s industrial emissions by two-thirds in 15 years
","Emma Gatten, ","
17 March 2021 • 6:00am
","The Government is to introduce a low-carbon kitemark to enable consumers to choose greener products, as it aims to cut industrial emissions by two-thirds in 15 years, the business secretary will announce today.  A new Industrial Decarbonisation Strategy will also commit more than £1 billion to help install solar panels, LED lights and insulation to help schools, hospitals and councils to go green. It will also look at carbon pricing to ensure industry takes pollution into their business decisions, and invest £171 million for low carbon technology including carbon capture usage and storage projects in nine industrial areas across the north, Scotland and south Wales. The strategy forms part of the Government’s response to industry-led calls for more support to decarbonise in the face of competition from  and as part of its  Heavy industry is one of the most polluting sectors in the UK, with industries such as steel a particular challenge to decarbonise.

Roz Bulleid, deputy policy director at Green Alliance, said: “The commitment to look at near zero ore-based steelmaking by 2035 is welcome, but the country needs to move quickly if our steel industry is not to be left behind.”"
business,,,,,"Chancellor Rishi Sunak’s Eat Out to Help Out scheme proved to be incredibly popular last summer; the Government part-subsidised meals bought in restaurants to encourage customers to go out and spend with the struggling hospitality sector. Now a new campaign is calling for a similar initiative, this time designed to save Britain’s independent high street shops, which have taken a financial hit during the pandemic and remained closed since 6th January.  The ‘Shop Out to Help Out’ scheme, proposed by campaign group Save The Street and marketing firm Appear Here, suggests that the Government should cover 50 percent of the cost of goods bought at independent retailers, capped at £10.  The organisation asks for the promotion to run for a month in the summer, offering discounts on Mondays, Tuesdays and Wednesdays, just as the ‘eat out’ effort did last year.  Specifically designed to help independent British non-essential retail businesses, the proposal is to offer the support to retailers with fewer than 10 employees, selling through bricks and mortar stores. It is suggested that a sales tax could be applied to booming online retailers, in order to pay for the package. So far the scheme’s high-profile backers include Mary Portas, Charlotte Tilbury, Nick Wheeler (owner of Charles Tyrwhitt), Chrissie Rucker (owner of The White Company) and British Fashion Council chair Caroline Rush.  It is certainly an engaging pitch. Non-essential retailers are estimated to have lost sales worth £22 billion in the last year due to national and local lockdowns.   have been lost in the last year, thanks to large casualties such as the closure of Debenhams stores, and the division and sale of Sir Philip Green’s Arcadia group. When shops finally are able to reopen on 12th April, it may become unavoidably, visually clear to see exactly what our once-vibrant high street parades look like now. The lights may well remain out in many shop fronts - stores from Topshop to Oasis, Debenhams to John Lewis, which occupy streets and centres from Penzance to Inverness, will all be gutted. The half-empty ghost-towns that remain will likely find it even harder to entice shoppers back for an appealing day of browsing. Small fashion boutiques, independent book shops, gift stores and more local specialists might expect to suffer further as a result. ""Covid 19 has chipped away at the brilliant diversity of our high streets up and down our country,"" says retail expert Mary Portas of the reason she is backing the campaign. “We need to act now and harness the support, need and love that people have for our high streets. These local businesses during the pandemic have held our communities together. A scheme like this will bring a vital lease of life back to the places that mean so much to us all.” Successfully coaxing footfall back into town centres will be the only way that many independent retailers will survive when they reopen. Just as the ‘Eat Out to Help Out’ scheme prompted many customers to spend lots more than the Government-covered amount, adding on drinks, sides and more courses to their meals, so too might the ‘Shop Out to Help Out’ scheme see consumers spend well over the £10 threshold, buying several, or more expensive items, and visiting multiple retailers in town once they are out and have already spent their single-use voucher.  Monday 12th April, the date which shops in England can officially reopen, has as such been declared ‘Indepent’s Day’ by the group. Whether the Government chooses to fund the proposed scheme in the summer or not, messaging for the date is clear; shop on your local high street, or lose it."

Bill Hwang and the debt-fuelled Archegos implosion that triggered a Wall Street earthquake

The Wall Street trader is at the centre of a storm around trades that went badly wrong, landing major banks with heavy losses
","Lucy Burton, ","
29 March 2021 • 3:47pm
","Unlike many top traders in the charged, materialistic world of Wall Street, Bill Hwang has always believed in a higher power. A committed Christian whose father was a preacher, Hwang has never made a secret of his religion. “God certainly has a long-term view,"" he said in a 2018 video. ""We love seeing in our little eyes what God is doing through investing and capitalism."" That faith may have been shaken by the events of the past few days. Hwang's family office, Archegos, has been  . More than $35bn was wiped off a string of major global stocks on Friday, raising fears that this could echo the 1998 collapse of Long Term Capital Management,    The saga centres around Archegos defaulting on its so-called margin call,  . This is triggered when trades go wrong. In this case, disaster seems to have struck with Archegos’ bet on American media group ViacomCBS, which saw its value drop by half last week.  Some of the banks who helped Archegos make leveraged bets on shares are now nursing huge losses.  Swiss banking giant  Credit Suisse,  which was already battling with the fallout from the collapse of finance firm Greensill Capital , has warned that the impact could be ""highly significant and material to our first quarter results"" while Nomura said it was braced for a $2bn hit ""arising from transactions with a US client"".  The crisis has rattled the City, with traders saying they have more questions than answers. At this stage, however, market watchers are downplaying suggestions that this crisis could unravel into another Long Term Capital Management scenario, with Patrick Ghali of Sussex Partners saying the situation currently feels ""contained"".  ""The question is how long this will continue,"" he says.  The saga raises questions about the risks banks are taking – ""a bank shouldn't lose a quarter worth of profitability due to one client,"" Ghali adds – and shines a spotlight on the sector's relationships with hedge funds and family offices. Alex Brazier, the Bank of England’s executive director for financial stability strategy and risk, said on Monday that ""we've been reminded, if it were needed, that the non-bank system and the banking system are not too hermetically sealed separate things. What happens in one affects the other.”   Charles Delingpole, the chief executive of technology company ComplyAdvantage, believes that family office relationships with Wall Street ""need to be revisited and further interrogated"".  ""To have premier tier Wall Street investment banks acting as prime brokers to entities that have exhibited adverse behaviour in the past demonstrates that 'know your customer' policies are either becoming too lax or being improperly enforced,"" he said. Hwang was charged with illegal trading in 2012.  Hwang's rise began in the Nineties when he was hired by legendary hedge fund Tiger Management shortly after being given a $50,000 prize for being the person outside the firm to benefit it the most. Hwang was working for another bank at the time and counted Tiger as a client. Tiger was renowned as a money-making machine with a relentless focus on detail. When founder Julian Robertson got a tip in the 1980s that a Korean car manufacturer was about to recall a model due to an engine problem, he went and bought two of the cars to get the answer himself. Not wanting to rely on secondhand information, he  Hwang - who moved with his family to Las Vegas from Korea when he was a child - became one of 30 or 40 so-called 'Tiger Cubs' who worked with the hedge fund king and were taught how to ""use teeth and claws to motivate people"", according to the book  Hwang was later given money to start Tiger Asia, which in 2012 was charged with illegal trading involving Chinese bank stocks and making $16.7m in illicit profits.  He agreed to criminal and civil settlements and later closed down the fund. In 2014, he was banned from trading in Hong Kong for four years.  Little known in the UK, the financier has until now kept a low profile running his family office Archegos Capital Management. That relative privacy has now been exploded by Friday's share sell-off. Hwang will doubtless be praying for the circus to move on."

Champions League revamp delayed amid row over extra spots

Under the proposed new format the likes of Liverpool could still qualify even if they finish outside the Premier League top four
",Ben Rumsby,"
30 March 2021 • 2:41pm
","Plans to force through a controversial new Champions League format on Wednesday have been scrapped at the 11th hour amid a major row over who gets the extra places in the competition. Uefa had been planning to   for almost 30 years – one that would see the likes of Liverpool qualify if they finished outside the Premier League top four – but announced on Tuesday that an official decision would take place instead on April 19 ""in order to finalise ongoing discussions"". The announcement followed a meeting of its Club Competitions Committee which broke up without agreement over exactly how the four additional places in the Champions League should be allocated. That committee includes Uefa executive committee member David Gill – the former Manchester United chief executive – and his successor at Old Trafford, Ed Woodward, as well as Manchester City chief executive Ferran Soriano. The plan had been to award two of the additional four places in the new 36-team Champions League to sides based on their historical record in Europe – limited to those that qualify for one of Uefa’s other club competitions – one to the fifth-strongest league, currently France, and one to the champions of the highest-ranked smaller country not to qualify by right. This is viewed by many as being too heavily weighted in favour of clubs from the big leagues, who would benefit from a major safety net in the event of a bad season, such as faltering Premier League champions Liverpool are currently enduring. European football’s governing body was already   and others by expanding the competition from 32 to 36 teams and 125 matches to 225 from the 2024/25 season. That would also see the current group stage replaced by a so-called ‘Swiss system’ under which all qualified teams would be guaranteed 10 games instead of six, five at home and five away against opponents of different strength. Controversially, it would also see half of the additional four places   in Europe provided they qualify for one of Uefa’s other club competitions. That would provide a major safety net for big clubs having a bad season, such as faltering Premier League champions Liverpool's current campaign. The extra 100 games would also require an additional four match-days, placing huge pressure on the English football calendar in particular and threatening the futures of the FA Cup and EFL Cup. The ‘Swiss system’ would see the Champions League group stage change from eight groups of four teams to one group table in which those finishing in the top eight would qualify automatically for the knockout stage and those finishing between ninth and 24th would enter a play-off for the remaining eight places. First used in chess, the format has been adopted to spice up what has become increasingly seen as a stale and predictable group stage of the competition. The knockout stage would remain unchanged. Plans for back-door access for historically-successful clubs have helped stave off the threat  , although critics argue it would nevertheless widen the chasm between the haves and have-nots. There are also major fears the expanded competition will cannibalise non-qualified clubs’ domestic revenues. Christian Purslow, the Aston Villa chief executive, has  , while Steve Parish, the Crystal Palace chairman, has said Uefa’s plans will ""have a quite devastating effect on domestic competition in England"". In basic terms, it is a massive expansion of European football’s elite club competition from 32 teams to 36, and 125 matches to 225, from 2024/25. More fundamentally, it would see a complete revamp of the group stage. Instead of eight groups of four teams where sides play the three others in their group home and away, it would consist of one single group in which each team will play five home matches and five away matches against 10 different opponents. Each team would be seeded and play opponents of varying strength. This is known as the ‘Swiss system’, a format pioneered by chess and since adopted by other sports. The sides who finish in the top eight will qualify automatically for the knockout stage, while those finishing between ninth and 24th will enter a play-off to determine the remaining eight last-16 spots. The knockout stage will remain unchanged but the new format nevertheless will represent the biggest shake-up of the competition since it became the Champions League three decades earlier. Money. The 100 extra matches alone would allow Uefa and clubs to command more in television and sponsorship income. The ‘Swiss system’, which guarantees each participating team 10 matches instead of six, has been adopted for the same reason in the hope it will be more attractive than a group stage increasingly viewed as stale and predictable. It is also designed to stave off the perceived threat of a European Super League, something highlighted by two of the additional four spots going to teams based on historical performances. One would go to the league rated the fifth-strongest in Europe, which is currently France, which would join England, Germany, Spain and Italy with four guaranteed spots. Another will go to the highest-ranked domestic champion from one of the smaller leagues. But, in the most controversial format change of all, the remaining two would go to the clubs with the highest Uefa coefficient (historic ranking) who qualified for one of its other club competitions. That would mean the likes of Liverpool could finish as low as seventh in the Premier League and still be parachuted into the Champions League. The expanded competition would require another four match-weeks on top of the 15 already carved out. That will be almost impossible to fit into the existing English football calendar, meaning something will have to give. There is no chance of the size of the Premier League being cut, meaning the impact will be felt by either or both of the FA Cup and – more likely – EFL Cup. The future of the latter competition is very much under threat, with England now the only country with two domestic cups. The winners are the big clubs, the richest of which are likely to get even richer. The losers will almost certainly be smaller teams and especially those who do not qualify for the Champions League. The additional 100 games risks cannibalising domestic revenues from the Premier League right down to League Two and Uefa will now be under major pressure to ensure any shortfall is filled by making solidarity payments. Whether the new format entrenches the on-field dominance of the big clubs remains to be seen but history suggests it will. The ‘Swiss system’ as a concept has been met by almost no opposition. But that is where the consensus ends. Complaints range from the new format’s back-door access for big clubs to the sheer number of additional matches. The European Leagues held a meeting of more than 300 clubs this month at which EFL chairman Rick Parry warned that if the EFL Cup was sacrificed, it would deduct a third of his organisation’s income and threaten the existence of lower-division clubs. Crystal Palace chairman Steve Parish added: ""This would have a devastating effect on domestic competitions in England. The League Cup is the largest financial contributor to the Football League and this will either be the end of that cup in its entirety or reduce it to a youth competition."""

Maxed out your Isa? Here's how to save another £80,000 from the taxman
","
If your annual Isa allowance has been used up, there are still ways to keep your cash away from the taxman’s clutches
",Marianna Hunt,"
30 March 2021 • 12:30pm
","Savers who max out their   need to be savvy about where they put their money, as a bad decision could end up costing them more than £80,000. Once someone has used up their £20,000 allowance for this tax year, any remaining funds they wish to invest will have to be put into a general investment account. This is less efficient, as any gains or income made may incur tax, whereas in an Isa they would not.  However, making wise choices about which investments they hold inside the Isa and which they put in the general account could improve their returns by 0.32 percentage points, analysis by Vanguard, the fund group, found.   The firm’s James Norton said: “In general you should hold assets that generate most of your income, such as bonds,  – otherwise this could be taxed. It is better to put stocks and funds into a general account.” That is because many stocks and funds provide little or no income and   as they expect their value to grow. This will eventually be taxed as capital gains, but investors currently enjoy relatively generous CGT allowances. For those that do pay a dividend, investors can take £2,000 a year in income tax free when they hold them in a general account – whereas the maximum amount they can take in income from bonds without incurring tax is £1,000 in the same scenario. Investors also pay lower income tax rates on dividend payments: 7.5pc for basic-rate taxpayers, 32.5pc for higher-rate ones and 38.1pc for those paying the additional tax rate. By contrast, once they have used up their personal savings allowance any income from bonds in a general account is subject to full income tax.  The personal savings allowance is currently £1,000 for non-taxpayers or those paying the basic tax rate, and £500 for higher-rate payers. Additional-rate taxpayers do not get an allowance.  Although the exact amount saved will depend on what investments a person owns and which tax bracket they are in, Vanguard found that on average someone who had half their money invested in bonds and half in stocks would be 0.32 percentage points better off if they held the former in their Isa and the latter in their general account, compared with the other way around.  Starting with a pot worth £250,000, over 10 years the difference between earning 5pc after tax and fees versus 5.32pc would mean having either £325,800 or £335,800. The poor placement of their investments would therefore leave a person £10,000 worse off. Over 30 years, they would be £82,600 poorer, with a pot worth £864,400 rather than £947,000 (see table above).  Lee Goggin of Find A Wealth Manager, an industry database, said savers who exceeded their Isa allowance could consider transferring shares to a spouse who had not done so, or open a  .  “Putting money into your pension rather than a general investment account is also very tax efficient, as you get relief on anything you put in – plus you don’t pay capital gains tax on the returns. The maximum you can currently gain tax relief on is £40,000 per year,” Mr Goggin said. It is also possible to contribute to a partner’s pension, and gain tax reliefs for them.  Alternatively, savers who max out their Isa could funnel money into other assets that are not liable for tax. John Williams of Nedbank Private Wealth, a private bank, said: “Investors putting money into   and enterprise investment schemes are rewarded for taking this higher level of risk with tax relief of 30pc of the cost of the shares, which can be set against their tax liability for the year in that they bought the shares. “Enterprise schemes also have the option to ‘carry back’ the relief to the previous year.” You do not normally pay CGT on either of these.  People investing their money in collectable items such as classic cars, watches or  that are not expected to last longer than 50 years can also avoid a bill if they later sell them for a gain. Also known as “wasting chattels”, these can be hard to sell and prices are often volatile. If you used them for business purposes at any time, the tax relief no longer applies.  Another option for reducing your tax liability is to  . Carla Morris of Brewin Dolphin, the financial planner, said: “You can claim back the difference between the rate of income tax you normally pay and the basic rate on the donation. For higher-rate taxpayers that is 20pc.” For example, if a higher-rate taxpayer donated £100 to charity via gift aid, the latter could then claim £25 from the Government, while the individual could claim 20pc of the total donation back, which is £25.  “There is currently no capital gains liability for any land, property or shares that you give freely to charity,” Ms Morris added."

Committee to probe David Cameron over Greensill links to Government

The standards watchdog is set to look at the former prime minister's links to and lobbying for Greensill

","David Cameron is facing a probe by a standards committee over his links to financier Lex Greensill and lobbying efforts for the eponymous lending firm that collapsed earlier this month. The Committee on Standards in Public Life – an independent advisory body that advises Number 10 on ethical standards – has privately indicated it would consider submissions made by the Labour party, reported the  It follows reports Mr Greensill had an unpaid role at the heart of the Government, before taking the former prime minister on as an adviser in 2018. The opposition has urged the committee in writing to investigate how Mr Greensill, a friend and former Morgan Stanley colleague of Jeremy Heywood – who was cabinet secretary under Mr Cameron – was   a decade ago. In his role, which was never announced, he would have had access to at least 11 Government departments, before being given a formal role as a “crown commissioner” in 2014. According to the FT, Sir Alistair Graham, who chaired the standards watchdog until 2007, has called for a “full inquiry” into the allegations, describing them as a “genuine scandal”.

He said he was certain “GFG did not break any rules” in its borrowing from the Covid loan scheme. Ministers are understood to have refused the £170m loan for Liberty due to concerns about GFG’s opaque corporate structure and whether the money could end up supporting operations overseas. A GFG Alliance spokesman said: “Most of GFG’s businesses across its global portfolio are performing well and generating positive cash flow, supported by the operational improvements we’ve made and strong steel, aluminum and iron ore markets. “In the UK, GFG has invested significantly to rescue steel and aluminium plants saving thousands of jobs in industrial communities across the UK. “The business is also working on solutions to provide additional working capital facilities to replace the funding gap left by Greensill.”"
business,,,,,"With just under two weeks to go before the tax year ends on April 5, now is the time to finalise your planning. There are many ways to cut your tax bill and changes today can protect yourself from future expenditure. Here are some of the key issues for consideration: 1) We all need to save for our old age because the state pension is unlikely to be sufficient on its own. If you have a Self-Invested Pension Plan (Sipp) consider topping up before the year end, particularly if you are a higher-rate taxpayer. If you are losing some of your personal income tax allowance because you earn over £100,000, this can be particularly efficient because it may give you an effective saving at 60pc.  2) If you are a member of a company scheme, and the rules allow it, consider making  . 3) You can contribute to a Sipp and claim basic-rate tax relief for up to £2,880 a year regardless of your earnings, with the fund claiming £720 from HM Revenue & Customs to give £3,600 gross benefit. This is useful for non-working spouses. If you can afford to do so you could also start a pension for your children on this basis. 4) Some people prefer to save in an Isa, but why not have both. The contribution limit this year is £20,000  Pension funds and Isas are essentially  , and with interest rates at rock bottom don’t fall into the trap of leaving everything in cash. Shares will almost always outperform cash over the long term. 5) If you are over 18 and under 40 there is just time to set up a Lifetime Isa. You can use a Lifetime Isa to buy your first home or save for later life. You are allowed to save up to £4,000 of your Isa allowance each year until you are 50 and benefit from the 25pc Government contribution. 6) Don’t just think about this tax year. The start of the new year is also a great time to make pension and Isa contributions and get the benefit of a full of year tax free growth. 7) We currently have a   of £12,300. If you have shares or unit trusts it may make sense to sell enough before the year end to use up this exemption. 8) Transfers between spouses or those in a civil partnership are tax free with the recipient taking over the base cost of the assets gifted. This effectively doubles up the potential saving available because they can sell them and cover the gain with their own exemption 9) You may want to make a disposal to  but keep the shares at the higher cost base. If so, under the ""bed and breakfast"" rules, you will need to wait 30 days before buying the shares again. However, there is nothing to stop your spouse buying them back in the market straight away. This does not work with a direct transfer between spouses 10) If you have an investment property one of the problems is that the whole gain is made on a sale so this only allows use of one exemption. Split ownership with your spouse can again help. In addition, consider making a transfer of part of the property each your to your adult children. This can be achieved with a declaration of trust declaring the proportions that the property will then be held 11) You may see advertisements at this time of year featuring the tax attractions of Venture Capital Trusts (VCTs) and the Enterprise Investment Schemes (EISs). I do not want to knock these and there have been a some great successes. However, they have favoured tax treatment to compensate for the higher investment risks involved. In addition, experienced investors will have already chosen from the offers available several months ago. Late arrivals may not be the best ones to go for. 12) We are a generous nation and gift aid has been a great assistance in encouraging donations to charitable causes. There is no annual limit and if you are a higher-rate taxpayer, or perhaps have income above £100,000 and see your personal allowance reduced, consider making a donation before the tax year. Non-taxpayers should take care because the relief claimed by the charity  . Ask your spouse to make the payment instead if they are a taxpayer 13) You may wonder why our tax year ends on April 5. Until 1752 it traditionally ended on Lady Day, March 25. However, when we moved to the Gregorian calendar 11 days had to be chopped off the year. Big landowners would not give up 11 days rent and forced the government to lengthen the tax year to April 5. Call me a traditionalist but I sincerely hope that we no more move this date than agree to drive on the right hand side of the road."
sport,,,,,"Mohamed Salah interviews are like an undercooked prime steak on an otherwise empty plate. Very rare and leaving you wanting more. That’s why - and this is intended with all due respect to esteemed Spanish publications  and  - the country of his newspapers of choice is more interesting than anything the Liverpool striker has said in his most recent exclusive chats. As was the case when Salah discussed his future with the Spanish press last December, there are no bombshell revelations in his latest Q&A. There is nothing in there that bothers Liverpool or Jurgen Klopp because the responses are cloudy enough to encourage supportive or suspicious minds  . When inevitably asked if he is keen to play in Spain, Salah's response barely qualifies as a ‘come and get me’ plea. “Why not? No one knows what's going to happen in the future, so... maybe one day, yes,” said Salah.  , Salah played down any sense of a lingering grudge against Sergio Ramos for inflicting the shoulder injury which prematurely ended his participation in the Champions League final of 2018 - the last time Liverpool and Real met in the competition as they prepare for next week's quarter-final. “That game is in the past, so I don't think about it,” he said, although there is a contradictory admission that he has ‘a special motivation to win the tie and go through to the semi finals’. However this is taken, a bloodthirst for vengeance does not spill from the page.  A cynic may read it as a means to ensure there is nothing in the way of Salah and Ramos becoming team-mates in future. The more charitable interpretation is this shows how Salah is a damn good bloke who shrugs off his disappointments. The effusive praise for Real coach Zinedine Zidane (“a great coach... one of my idols when I was little”) makes for a curious contrast with the matter-of-fact description of his relationship with Klopp (“a normal relationship between two professionals”), but this is another by-product of a player who generally shuns microphones after having every sentence forensically examined.  The popular conclusion that Salah is conducting such an interview to ingratiate himself to the Real Madrid manager and fans has merit, but also a critical flaw. Whether Madrid are interested in him or not, such articles will not make any difference to future negotiations. Salah could hold a press conference in the centre of Madrid and say he has always felt more comfortable wearing a white shirt if he so wished, and it would not nudge a deal an inch closer. Only Salah and his representatives can answer if there is an ulterior motive to  . The fact Liverpool are about to play Real Madrid makes the most recent interview easier to understand than the last one in mid-season. But if we are to make the speculative leap that it is part of a transfer strategy, it suggests a bizarre mis-reading of this summer’s market. If Real Madrid want to sign a world-class striker whose contract runs until 2023, it will take a mind-boggling sum for a player who turns 29 in June. And it's well documented Zinedine Zidane's heart is set on 22-year-old Kylian Mbappe. That’s why Liverpool’s relaxed approach in 2021 is in stark contrast to when the noise of La Liga interest overshadowed Luis Suarez before his move in 2014, and Philippe Coutinho’s in 2017. The transfer market and the financial circumstances around the La Liga clubs was different then. And Liverpool were a different club, too. Most important of all, Liverpool are comfortable because Salah has always delivered, even during this troubling season at Anfield. When the Klopp era is chronicled, Salah will be one of those legends revered for elevating the club back to its historic heights. He may win the Premier League golden boot again, and he is one of those players whose appearance record makes him as reliable as his strike-rate. He is only ever absent at a doctor’s insistence, playing through every tweak of pain. Such exemplary conduct can be taken for granted, but at a club where memories of Suarez and Coutinho taking extreme measures to force through a La Liga move still burn - the latter once failing to train because of a bad back that would have mystified some of the world’s leading chiropractors - the fact Salah keeps giving slightly flirty interviews about his desire to play in Spain is categorised as trivial. Asked if it is time to move after four years at Anfield, Salah replied: “It's not up to me. We'll see what happens but I prefer not to talk about that now.” Not for the first time, there are cryptic messages to chew over. Fortunately for Liverpool, there is nothing ambiguous about the excellence of Salah’s ongoing deeds as he bids for a second Champions League win in three years."

business,,,,,"Swiss banking has a reputation for being crushingly dull but that’s kind of the point. In an industry that was literally invented for rich people to hide their wealth, discretion is paramount. Yet Credit Suisse, a giant of the country’s banking and business establishment, seems to lurch from one damaging crisis to another. The impression is of an organisation that has become ungovernable. It is no shock to discover that the bank is among those most exposed to the  . In a widespread sell-off of European financial stocks, shares in Credit Suisse crashed 16pc after it warned of a “highly significant and material” impact on profits. But for once, the bank isn’t really the story. The huge unwinding of positions at Archegos, a private investment firm founded by  , has prompted panic on Wall Street along with much soul-searching about how Hwang came to be at the heart of things in the first place. The money manager settled insider trading charges in the US in 2012, and two years later was banned from trading in Hong Kong. Yet somehow Archegos, which is essentially a family office managing the fortunes of a handful of wealthy clients, was able to build up billions of dollars worth of leverage with many of the world’s largest investment banks and the capacity to cause vicious swings in world markets. It has already been described as “a Lehman moment” for nervous markets but there are probably more parallels with the implosion of Long Term Capital Management in the late 1990s. A crash was only averted when the Federal Reserve stepped in with a bailout of big banks exposed to the fund. Estimates are that Archegos accumulated something in the region of $10bn of assets. It then effectively borrowed money to make even bigger bets. Having already dumped $20bn of stocks associated with the fund, there is an expectation that investment banks are preparing for further stock sales. The hope is that the fallout is contained to Archegos but the fear is that spooks the banks into reining in the leverage they’ve extended to other hedge funds, triggering a series of other unexploded bombs. At best it shows the nervousness that currently exists in financial markets, at worst it could be the start of a massive sell-off that derails the global economic recovery. “It’s impossible to imagine modern life without steel,” tycoon Sanjeev Gupta said recently. Well, steel is going to have to start thinking about life without Gupta. The tycoon insists that his industrial outfit GFG Alliance remains “operationally strong” and has “adequate funding” despite  . Yet a plea for a £170m taxpayer bailout suggests otherwise, raising fears for 5,000 jobs at Gupta’s Liberty Steel arm. What happens next will be a test of this Government’s claim that it hasn’t abandoned its industrial strategy altogether, rather it has merely been rebranded as a Plan for Growth, whatever that means. Whitehall is understandably reticent to step in. The concern is that any financial aid might be used to finance other parts of the GFG operation instead of helping to save jobs. Gupta’s recent purchase of a £40m townhouse in Belgravia will do little to convince ministers that taxpayer money would be spent wisely. On one level, such reluctance is reassuring. GFG is such a financial basket case that ministers risk throwing good money after bad. But the Government will also be desperate to  . That risks a repeat of the fiasco which occurred when the Government stepped in at British Steel two years ago, propping it up at the cost of £1m a day while ministers sought a white knight. Buyers were so thin on the ground that, even after eight months scouring the globe, the Government had to practically give the company away to the Chinese.  , equivalent to £160,000 for every one of the roughly 3,000 jobs that were saved. One suspects interest in Liberty will be similarly scarce - and not just because of its immediate financial problems. The company is essentially a collection of distressed regional plants that bigger steelmakers had given up on. It was only Greensill’s unwavering backing, along with a mixture of dowries and state subsidies that enabled Gupta to give them a new lease of life. The time for quick fixes is long since passed; the Government needs to adopt an “all or nothing” approach. If the UK really does still have an industrial strategy then the steel industry is probably worth saving, and it should be done properly. That means deciding which products must be manufactured within our borders, who will make them and how we are going to source the raw necessary raw materials. If the Royal Navy needs British-made ships, then the  . And, as Business Secretary Kwasi Kwarteng recently pointed out, if you’re going to have a British Steel then you should probably have a British Coal too, to supply the coking material that fuels the furnaces. Of course, that’s not compatible with the Government’s recent commitment to be a net zero economy by 2050. But if it’s necessary, the Government needs to start making the case - and tough decisions like  . The alternative is letting an industry that is the mainstay of local economies up and down the country go bust. It would be drastic, and politically toxic, but perhaps there’s a way of winding down Liberty’s operations gradually while putting in place a genuine state-backed safety net that provides generous one-off payments for out-of-work steelworkers alongside retraining and help finding alternative jobs. Either way, ministers can’t keep crossing their fingers every time they’re faced with another crisis."

Facebook plans undersea cables with Google to boost south-east Asia internet
","
The social media giant claims the cables to Indonesia and Singapore will boost trans-Pacific internet capacity by 70pc
","Laurence Dodds, ","
29 March 2021 • 6:39pm
","Facebook is planning to build two new undersea internet cables between south-east Asia and North America to boost connections across the Pacific. The social media giant said it hopes to have both cables up and running by 2024, working with Google and local telecoms providers to create a new digital bridge between Singapore, Indonesia and the United States. Tech companies are increasingly helping fund the undersea cables that connect emerging markets to their US servers. Last year, a separate connection to Hong Kong was blocked last year by the Trump administration over security concerns. Kevin Salvadori, Facebook's vice president of network investments, told Reuters the new cables would be the first direct connections between North America and parts of Indonesia, which is the company's fifth biggest market and an increasingly important source of growth. One cable, called Echo, is a partnership between Facebook, Google and the Indonesian telecoms provider XL Axiata, while the other, Bifrost, involves Telkom, another Indonesian carrier, and Keppel, a Singaporean conglomerate. Mr Salvadori said: ""Those will be the first two cables to go through a new diverse route crossing the Java Sea, and they will increase overall subsea capacity in the trans-Pacific by about 70pc."" He added that the cables would require ""a very material investment"" from Facebook. They will still require regulatory approval. Indonesia is a big market for Facebook, with an estimated 130m users and widespread internet use but very few wired broadband connections,  . The Asia-Pacific region is one of Facebook's fastest-growing sources of revenue, accelerating by 31pc in the last three months of 2020 and an average of 27pc over the past two years. As well as the new cables, Facebook said last year that it would build 1,864 miles of fibre optic broadband linking 20 Indonesian cities, as well as a series of new public Wi-Fi hotspots.

After being cleared of sexual assault, tycoon vows to fight new allegations

","The financial elite were having a very good time in 1998, the year Lord Mandelson said Labour was “intensely relaxed about people getting filthy rich” as long as they pay their taxes. “It was before hedge funds were institutionalised. It was normal for everyone to behave appallingly all the time – hard drinking, hard smoking, loads of recreational drugs. This was the time Mayfair started to become cool again,” says one executive. “Mayfair was a total backwater.” But what is considered cool one decade is less so in another. The small number of women who worked in finance during those years do not look back fondly on the “good old days” of a gilded era. “Women being humiliated in this country is part of upper class culture,” says one senior businesswoman who has bad memories of that time. “These are ruthless people who are part of a ruthless system which is there to deny people their economic freedom.” One of the biggest characters from the buccaneering late 1990s and early 2000s is  , once dubbed one half of the “Posh and Becks” of the City and a regular at celebrity Mayfair members’ club 5 Hertford Street. After making £220m on the night of the Brexit vote with a bet that markets would fall, the Brexiteer turned to an Italian proverb to express his delight the following morning. “Il mattino ha l’oro in bocca” – the morning has gold in its mouth – he told the BBC. But much of that glow has since come off his fortunes.   and in the past few months he has been battling   dating back to 1998. He was   earlier this month, with district judge Nicholas Rimmer questioning why he had been charged after a decision not to prosecute him was overturned by a victim review. The woman claimed   put his hands on her breast and up her skirt before she “wrestled herself free and left”. Odey said he propositioned her after he “misread the signals” but did not grope her. New allegations have since surfaced. Last week Bloomberg News reported accusations of inappropriate behaviour from two unnamed sources, a former receptionist at his firm who claims Odey used to run his hand down her back when she was at work and a former client who alleges she was asked by Odey to be his mistress in exchange for the use of his flat during a business dinner over a decade ago. Odey’s spokesman says he denies all the allegations and will be instigating legal action against them. The claims nevertheless shine a spotlight on Britain’s hedge fund industry during an era of excess. One senior businesswoman says she feels the Mayfair set will always bat away claims of sexism and harassment simply as “a lunch gone wrong”. Odey admits that he may not have noticed the cultural changes going on around him in recent years as the male-dominated finance sector finally began to modernise. He is known throughout the Square Mile as one of the last of a City old guard fond of a long lunch. At one midweek meal with an   journalist, he paired steak and kidney pudding and mash with a “side order” of a loin of beef and two bottles of wine. “Things change, if you’re running a business for 30 years you sometimes don’t see how much the world is changing culturally. There is a bit of   in that,” he says. “There are definitely improvements we can make in our culture. [But] what we do in our private life does not affect our professional life. It’s a point of view.” Despite being acquitted, now aged 62 the financier faces having to rebuild his reputation. In the secretive hedge fund industry, reputation is everything. The amount Odey personally manages shrank to around $777m (£558m) at the end of last year, according to an investor letter seen by Bloomberg. Odey Asset Management, the company he founded in 1991, even changed the name of around £1.3bn worth of funds from “Odey” to “Brook” in the weeks before he was acquitted. Odey claims his business has been unaffected by the court case. “At the moment everyone wants to kill Odey but we have a resilient brand,” he argues. “I’ve had all the diversions of this court case, and all the kiss and tell stories, but we’re having a fantastic time across the board – our funds have grown by 30pc this year”. His male supporters – including one who recalls watching him get slapped in the face at an event – argue that nobody should be judged in this “intense, really sensitive climate” for things they did decades ago. “Now he seems like a figure out of time,” one said. “People flourish in different ages.” Robin Birley, the owner of 5 Hertford Street, insists his friend has never been banned from the club despite rumours that he was not seen there for some months in 2014 after being caught in a compromising position by a member of staff. “Crispin is both a personal friend and a valued member of 5 Hertford Street. “There is no truth at all in the claim that he has ever been banned from the club,” he says. Odey told the   in 2014 that the incident was a “joke spread by a friend”. Odey Asset Management’s website – which shows an all-male research team, male-only portfolio managers (of which half are also Oxford graduates) and just one woman on its management team – suggests it remains a relic of a bygone era. Many hope the hedonistic boys’ club where wealthy financiers such as Odey once felt so at home will finally begin to change."

Green Homes grant axed after six months following poor take-up

Kwasi Kwarteng, the Business Secretary, said the scheme will be replaced with £300m for local authorities for energy-saving home measures

","Rishi Sunak’s £2bn   is to shut after just six months following low take-up by the public. The insulation subsidy programme   is closing on Wednesday amid a failure to win widespread support. It was previously touted as a key part of government efforts to “build back greener” and meet the country’s climate goals, but was dogged by delays as would-be applicants struggled to get quotes for work from busy builders. Last week, a report by MPs accused ministers of underestimating the cost of improving the efficiency of many homes and asked for the scheme to be extended to accommodate the delays. The environmental audit select committee said the scheme was essential for improving Britain’s energy efficiency plans, but warned that delays in grant payments “had devastating consequences on many of the builders and installers that can do the work, who have been left in limbo as a result of the orders cancelled”. Before the decision to close the scheme was made, it was due to run until March 2022. The programme allowed English homeowners to apply for vouchers worth up to £10,000 to make their properties more efficient, cutting emissions and promising a saving on bills of up to £600 a year. The money could cover up to two thirds of the cost of improvements such as loft or cavity wall insulation and draught proofing. Kwasi Kwarteng, the Business Secretary, said an extra £300m will be made available for investing in energy-saving measures for homes instead, distributed by local authorities. A spokesman for the Business Department said: “Applications made before the end of March deadline will be honoured and any vouchers already issued may be extended upon request.”"

ITV teams up with venture capital as it battles the streaming giants
","
The broadcaster is looking to trade TV advertising space in exchange for stakes in promising startups
",Ben Woods,"
28 March 2021 • 2:37pm
","After enduring a brutal pandemic, Carolyn McCall will be praying that this year’s hopes for a summer of love come true. The   is betting on a sharp revival in the advertising market as Britain’s world-leading vaccine rollout takes effect - and relying on hits such as reality show   to tap into post-pandemic optimism. Advertising sales, which tumbled by £191m to £1.6bn last year, are poised to jump by up to 75pc next month as millions more jabs go in arms. But this growth may simply be masking a longer-term challenge as television fights for its future in an  . There are fears that the accelerated shift to digital during the pandemic may have forced TV advertisers into the hands of tech platforms. While some will flock back, others may never return. McCall is not taking such threats lying down. The 59-year-old former chief executive of EasyJet has unfurled a plan to help burnish ITV’s financial performance while nurturing a new generation of TV advertisers. ITV has launched ‘AdVentures Invest’, a media-for-equity fund where the broadcaster doles out TV advertising space in exchange for stakes in promising start-ups. The benefits are two-fold. If ITV backs the right company, it has the potential to make a hefty financial return that will support its own migration to streaming. Secondly, ITV can extol the virtues of the broadcasting world with a new breed of advertisers which may be   with the company’s ad platforms but overlooked the huge reach of TV. ITV plans to team up with venture capital funds to take up to 10 positions in companies over the next two years. Each offer will be worth more than £1m from a £15m pot set aside for the first 12 months. ITV has hired Niko Waesche to lead the charge, a venture capitalist who co-founded Germany’s leading media-for-equity fund German Media Pool. But can such modest media investments really compete in London’s fiercely competitive start-up scene that is flooded with venture capital and private equity funding? Even if they can, there is a risk ITV becomes lumbered with a string of companies that struggle to live up to their hype. Waesche is undaunted by the prospect. “Our programme is not to prove that TV works [...] it is about providing an option into the market that is superior to buying advertising with cash. The reason is because we have skin in the game,” he says. “That company knows we will provide our best people who have great insights into brand building and media strategy to help them be successful with a TV campaign. “We are primarily focused on the financial returns, but I think we can learn as much from the failures as we can from the successes of the companies we invest in.” In many ways, ITV is late to the party. Germany’s free-to-air broadcaster ProSieben has made a string of bets in digital companies through its media investment arm, SevenVentures. It was an early backer of Zalando, a German online fashion retailer that has grown into a tech juggernaut with a €22bn (£19bn) market value. UK media companies have also followed suit. Channel 4 Ventures - the broadcaster’s media-for-equity fund - has invested in the social media platform Pinterest and plant-based food business The Meatless Farm.  owner DMGT allows start-ups to target readers of the MailOnline or the   using such a model through its investment arm DMG Ventures. On Thursday, ITV announced its first investment when it took a £3m stake in  , a London-based digital mapping firm that has carved up the planet into 3m squares carrying three words to identify them. The platform, which has also attracted investment from Channel 4, claims to be a more efficient way of tracking locations than using a standard street address. It is an important marker for ITV, but the broadcaster may not always be able to have its own way in a start-up scene market awash with funding options. By zeroing in on consumer-focused firms, Waesche believes his company can hold its own. “We have to try and make our fund as pro-entrepreneurial as possible,” he adds. “That means we cannot be viewed as his big clunky corporate, but somebody that can make quick decisions and is used to the venture capital process. “ITV must be a highly-compatible and lean co-investor. We have spoken to the leading venture capital funds in the UK and we will expect them to be the lead in a transaction. “We are telling the VC’s ‘if you want to have a strong television partner at your side then we are there for you, but we are not going to be very difficult to deal with’. “Please invite us in and we promise to add value.” Berenberg analyst Sarah Simon says ITV’s funds will be offering an attractive proposition to budding entrepreneurs, but questions whether they can be as successful as Prosieben. Tom Harrington of Enders Analysis says ITV could get a double benefit, with “a gainful return on an exit like Pinterest for Channel 4” and advertising sales that have the potential to be “many times over the initial investment”. Waesche expects to hold each investment for up to five years before weighing a sale to another venture capital fund. By then, McCall will have hoped to have made some healthy returns to help cushion ITV’s transition to a purely digital world - starting with a bumper summer."

","The final bank note to switch from paper to plastic will soon be in circulation, as the new £50 featuring mathematician, code-breaker and computer scientist Alan Turing launches this summer. It will replace the note featuring steam engine pioneers James Watt and Matthew Boulton, who first appeared on the note in 2011.  The launch of the new £50 note follows the successful introduction of a polymer  featuring Sir Winston Churchill,   in 2017, and   with painter JMW Turner. Mr Turing was pivotal to cracking the German codes enciphered with their Enigma machine during the Second World War. This allowed the allies to read German naval communications and helped shorten the war.  In a nod to Mr Turing's code-breaking skills,   that the agency's chief puzzler says will take seven hours to crack.  Mr Turing also played a pivotal role in the development of early computers and set the foundations for work on artificial intelligence by considering the question of whether machines could think.  Turing was homosexual and was posthumously pardoned by the Queen having been convicted of gross indecency for his relationship with a man.  Alan Turing's portrait is based on a photo taken in 1951 by Elliott & Fry which is part of the Photographs Collection at the National Portrait Gallery.

UK’s OneWeb battles Elon Musk in broadband space race
","
Fears are growing for OneWeb as Elon Musk’s SpaceX makes rapid advances in the satellite broadband race
",Matthew Field,"
27 March 2021 • 12:00pm
","On opposite sides of the Earth and just hours apart, rockets from satellite companies OneWeb and SpaceX blasted off this week, each delivering a payload of dozens of small satellites into low orbit. British-owned OneWeb,  , fired 36 satellites into space on the nose of a Soyuz rocket from the Vostochny Cosmodrome in Russia’s far east. Around 6,670 miles away, Elon Musk’s SpaceX shot 60   into the sky from Cape Canaveral on the Florida coast. Musk’s Falcon 9 reusable launchers landed at sea aboard the robotic Of Course I Still Love You ship in the Atlantic. The launches are the latest stage in an accelerating space race between the two companies. Both firms want to blanket the Earth with satellites  . Despite OneWeb securing £400m in government investment, observers have noted SpaceX appears to have gained an early lead. Since January, users in the UK have been able to sign up to a beta trial of SpaceX’s service, installing a satellite dish that links up to one of its satellites circling about 690 miles above the Earth’s surface. Some have reported speeds in excess of 150 megabits per second. For that, they pay £89 per month. By selling these dishes directly to consumers, SpaceX hopes to bypass telcos and shake-up the market. But Neil Masterson, the new chief executive of OneWeb, doesn’t appear fazed. “We are not fighting the industry, but working with them.” OneWeb is hoping to sell to telecoms companies such as BT to reach remote rural locations. Founded in 2012, the company was a pioneer in the design and construction of mega-constellations of hundreds of satellites that could provide global broadband. It raised $3.4bn from the likes of Japan’s SoftBank, but it came unstuck last March when investors pulled the plug on new funding. An unexpected white knight came in the form of the British Government,  , which secured a $1bn deal to buy the remains of the company last year. But by the time OneWeb restarted launches in December, SpaceX had ramped up its own efforts. “OneWeb were the innovators in launching a big constellation,” says Marek Ziebart, a professor at University College London. “With Elon Musk, as typically happens in tech, someone else had burnt the research and development dollars doing the high-risk process of proving something can be done, and once it is done the vultures come down.” Musk’s Starlink now has more than 1,300 satellites in orbit, covering much of the northern hemisphere. In the UK, it offers its service around 50 degrees latitude north and expects to cover Britain by the end of the year. OneWeb’s Masterson says its own service, which as of Thursday morning had 146 satellites in orbit, will provide coverage from the “North Pole to Cornwall” by the end of the year. Rather than going directly to punters, OneWeb is portraying itself as an ally to telecoms companies. “One of our shareholders [Bharti] is one of the largest telcos in the world, and we have an   into every single telco around the world. It is the natural approach for us,” he says. That offer of help will be welcome in very rural areas where the cost of installing fibre is uneconomical. Network insiders believe a company like OneWeb, working on a business-to-business basis, would be useful for providing redundancy to fibre networks, in particular to critical infrastructure. However, many still see it as a niche solution. Some experts also do not believe the ultra high speeds enjoyed by early Starlink customers are sustainable.  With only a few thousand trial customers, high speeds are inevitable. “How this will work with hundreds of thousands of customers is unclear,” one telecoms expert says. Analysts say the ultimate winner in the race for a global constellation remains unclear. “OneWeb certainly lost some of its lead during Chapter 11 proceedings,” says Caleb Henry, an analyst at consultancy Quilty Analytics. “But OneWeb’s smaller constellation means it is not necessarily behind SpaceX.” OneWeb has roughly 22pc of its network complete, Quilty says, compared with about 11pc coverage by Starlink. Masterson says OneWeb is planning between eight and 10 launches this year as it seeks to regain its position against Starlink.  The UK-backed firm has also joined a pushback by satellite companies against Starlink’s vast expansion, which has seen a dash for territory in space – Starlink’s ultimate goal is to have 12,000 satellites over Earth.  In a recent filing to the US communications regulator, OneWeb argued SpaceX’s constellation would cause “harmful interference” and claimed its satellites had a “troubling failure rate” and were “plagued” with safety issues. SpaceX declined to comment. But OneWeb has its own critics. This week, MPs including Darren Jones, the chairman of the business committee, quizzed Prime Minister Boris Johnson over the transparency of the deal, and whether he had been personally involved in brokering it. Mr Johnson said: “I don’t think I could comment on exactly who did what.” At the time of the investment, which was championed by Dominic Cummings, a senior civil servant and the UK’s Space Agency questioned whether it represented value for money for the British taxpayer. OneWeb has another potential way to gain an advantage over Starlink. It could be used as a kind of redundancy system to GPS, which is made up of 24 satellites 12,000 miles up. OneWeb’s system could be used as a position, navigation and timing [PNT] system to prevent jamming or to step in if GPS went down, an issue that is feared would cost the UK £1bn per day. “This capability is not a target of SpaceX, and represents both a strategic and financial opportunity that could be sizeable,” Henry says. OneWeb is hoping to have its system fully operational by the middle of next year. It still has to raise about another $1bn to achieve this. It plans to scale up its business to around 480 people this year, almost the same number it had pre-bankruptcy, with 70pc in the UK.  In the race against a man as ambitious as Musk, there is no doubt it needs to make up for lost time."

How to reverse ageing Britain and ease pressure on its public finances
","
There are solutions that could at least cushion the economic blow, but they are unpopular, slow and long-term
",Tom Rees,"
21 March 2021 • 4:00pm
","Scotland is attempting to turn back the clock to save its economy. With an older population and a far lower fertility rate than the rest of the UK, Scotland risks becoming the country’s ageing epicentre. Mortality, fertility and migration was the three-pronged approach targeted in Holyrood’s first population strategy last week as it battles to de-age its workforce. Like much of the developed world, policymakers in Edinburgh are threatened with a fast ageing population that will slash the workforce, drain public money and spark a social care crisis. Scotland’s new strategy warned that an arsenal of weapons rather than a “silver bullet” will be needed as Covid worsens the problem. Widened access to pricey fertility treatment, incentives for families to set up in Scotland, and encouraging older people to   were among a package of measures proposed. But can such policies do enough to reverse the ageing of Britain’s population? While the extension of life expectancy has been a major medical achievement, it is causing headaches for economists. “A lot of people are really underestimating how massive the changes are in the demographic outlook for pretty much every country in the world,” says James Pomeroy, HSBC economist. “Over the course of the next decade, it will be the fastest pace of change of demographics globally that we’ve probably ever seen, and we’ll ever see, because we’re at this turning point.”  from being a tailwind for many economies to a major headwind as populations age. Developed economies will see their working age population shrink, but their older cohorts expand rapidly as the large baby boomer generation retires and lives for longer. The huge increases in life expectancy is a key driver of ageing populations, but economic forces are also at play. “The point about low wage jobs, low productivity [and] jobs with low social status is that it means often that people struggle to start families,” explains prof Adrian Pabst, deputy director at the National Institute of Economic and Social Research (NIESR). “Families either get delayed or never happen at all because they simply cannot afford it… wages are a huge area of concern here.” An ageing population means slower GDP growth, but higher public spending and a smaller tax base. Population is an important driver of economic activity with gains creating a larger workforce and consumer demand. “Scotland’s business base, the domestic customers that provide them with demand, and the workforce required to supply that demand are all derived from its resident population,” the population strategy explained. The Scottish government expects to suffer “significantly lower” increases in GDP than the rest of the UK because of its weaker population growth, while Japan’s shrinking working force   as labour shortages bite. A declining workforce means a smaller tax base that will struggle to raise enough revenue to pay for  . A worker aged 45 in the UK on average provides the most tax revenue to the state and takes out very little in public spending. That switches when that worker becomes elderly as their pension, social care and health costs sap money from the state. The Office for Budget Responsibility estimates that age-related spending is set to climb from 23pc of GDP in 2025 to 26.2pc in 2065, a rise sharper than any of the eurozone “big four” of France, Germany, Italy and Spain. A typical UK 89-year-old in 2021-22 is estimated to cost the state more than £30,000 a year, while the 45-year-old costs just £6,000, according to the Office for National Statistics. “The British state is changing shape to respond to pressures from the ageing boomer cohort,” warns Lord Willetts, the president of the Resolution Foundation’s intergenerational centre and a former Conservative minister. “What you see is an increase in NHS spend and an increase in pension spend. We become a health and pensions state and other services tend to fall away by comparison.”  is set to push the UK’s tax burden to 35pc of GDP, its highest level since the Sixties. But paying for an older population will likely mean Britons face  . “In the absence of any other change, it’s hard to see where else it could come from,” warns Pabst. He says the alternative is an insurance system that workers pay into, helping to cover care costs later on in life. Like many of the economic challenges facing policymakers, the pandemic threatens to amplify the problem. A  , with estimates suggesting that Britain’s birth rate may have fallen to record lows. HSBC believes the pandemic could mean the global population peaks a decade earlier than previously expected in the early 2050s, with huge implications for economies. The UK is still far from the full-blown population crises facing the likes of Japan. It remains middle of the pack in terms of fertility rates among developed economies, but will still endure huge population pressures. Pomeroy predicts the UK’s working age population could be declining this decade and will “certainly be shrinking in the 2030s”. If the UK’s fertility rate fell from its current level of 1.7 births per woman to around 1.2 or 1.3, levels currently seen in Spain and Italy, the population would almost halve by 2100 if there was no immigration, he estimates. “It actually could happen, these demographic risks are so underestimated,” Pomeroy warns. There are solutions that could at least cushion the economic blow, but they are unpopular, slow and long-term. Politicians have largely preferred to kick the can down the road than grasp the nettle. The easiest and quickest solution is to raise the retirement age, delaying the point that state pensions kick in and encouraging people to work for longer. More office-based employment and improving health makes extending working lives more viable, but it is fiercely unpopular. The UK’s state pension age will rise to 67 later this decade, while retirement age increases in other countries have knocked governments’ popularity. “You could just reduce the value of state pensions or not increase it so rapidly,” adds David Sturrock, economist at the Institute for Fiscal Studies. He warns the current “triple lock” that ensures pensions increase by the highest of earnings, prices or 2.5pc is “unsustainable” in the long term. Boosting immigration levels to bring in young workers that start families could also ease the pressure. While many developed economies face shrinking workforces, populations in many parts of the world are still growing rapidly. “Nigeria, Egypt, Philippines [and] India - these countries have got very fast growing populations,” says Pomeroy. “Migration could be theoretically a global solution, but as we know, that isn’t necessarily practical or politically popular in various parts of the world.” The holy grail for policymakers would be reviving fertility rates, but reversing decades-long trends could prove difficult. Boosting the number of births per woman would lift the number of young workers entering the labour market and widen the tax base to ease the pressure on the public finances. Economists argue that reducing childcare costs and bolstering the financial security of younger generations are vital in lifting births. “You really need to incentivize people and make the costs lower, which is what generally happened in Scandinavia,” says Pomeroy. With Scotland’s low fertility rate of 1.4, its new strategy included several measures to shore up young families. More affordable homes, support packages for families settling in Scotland, and expanding fertility treatment to groups such as single people and couples who already have a child are proposals being drawn up to de-age the population. Scotland is taking the first step towards solving its brewing population crisis but policymakers may need to be far more ambitious to turn back the clock."

Taxpayer-backed SNP deal which promised 2,000 jobs delivers fewer than 50
","
It was claimed smelter takeover would revitalise Lochaber economy, but tycoon's empire is now facing a crisis
","Daniel Sanderson, ","
24 March 2021 • 7:08pm
","Fewer than 50 of a promised 2,000 new jobs have been created as a result of a taxpayer-backed takeover of the UK’s last aluminium smelter, a senior SNP minister has admitted. Fergus Ewing, the SNP rural economy secretary, said the 44 additional people had been hired since the Scottish Government agreed to provide a 25-year financial guarantee,  that allowed steel magnate Sanjeev Gupta to take over an industrial site in Fort William, in 2016. Then, it was claimed that the investment would create 1,000 direct jobs and a further 1,000 indirect jobs, while adding £1 billion to the local economy, within a decade. However, Mr Gupta’s GFG Alliance is now facing a funding crisis,   Mr Ewing delivered a statement to Holyrood on Wednesday to address fears that Mr Gupta’s empire, which also includes the Dalzell steel plant in Motherwell, is now on the brink of collapse. Mr Ewing told MSPs that Mr Gupta had personally assured him last week of the “underlying operational health” of his Scottish assets despite acknowledging “challenges” caused by the collapse of Greensill.  Defending the Government’s   in a deal which also included nearby hydro plans used to power it and a large Lochaber estate, he said the alternative would have been to see the facility close. However, Willie Rennie, the Scottish LibDem leader, challenged Mr Ewing after he said there had been 44 new jobs at the site, taking the overall total to just 200. Mr Rennie said: “The Government told us five years ago that the multiplier and supply chain impacts in Lochaber would be worth 2,000 jobs. Are we ever going to see those jobs, and what discussions did he have with Mr Gupta about creating those jobs?” Mr Ewing replied that the jobs that had been created were “valuable” but admitted the firm’s original plans for building an alloy wheels plant “could not proceed” due to problems in the British car industry. He added: “That’s simply a fact that nobody anticipated in 2016, not Mr Rennie, not Mr me [sic], or anybody else. “However, the company have come forward with an amended plan which includes a billets plant and a [water] canning plant. There’s challenges ahead, but we are working extremely hard with everybody to achieve delivery of these objectives.” The deal the Scottish Government agreed with Mr Gupta in 2016 saw it agree to a 25-year guarantee to buy energy from the Lochaber hydro plants, should the smelter shut down, worth between £14m and £32m per year. "

Sir Ian Cheshire: the ex-Barclays boss eyeing BT's chairman role
","
The retail veteran vying for a top role at the telco talks lockdown life, the fate of high streets, and why BT's headwinds are behind it
",Oliver Gill,"
28 March 2021 • 5:00am
","Until the pandemic hit, Sir Ian Cheshire had always been on the move. Born in Borneo, where his father was working for oil giant Shell, Cheshire got to travel the world with his family as a child. Such a nomadic existence has continued during his career. Thirty years in retail, dovetailed with nearly a decade as one of the Government’s top business advisers, and seats on the boards of Barclays and Whitbread, left him almost permanently on the road. But the coronavirus lockdown has left one of Britain’s best-known executives marooned in his holiday home on the Isle of Wight. “I’ve never in my entire life spent one year in one place,” he says. “[But] swapping the Jubilee line for walking the dogs on the beach is not a bad trade.” Cheshire was appointed to the board of BT a year ago and chairman of Spire Healthcare earlier this month. Getting up to speed with new jobs over Zoom or Microsoft Teams calls has not been without its challenges. “I’ve just learned to allow an extra 10 minutes to swear at the screen,” he says. It is not the only thing he has learnt. A lifelong Bruce Springsteen and Rolling Stones fan, Cheshire has recently found himself enjoying the Taylor Swift tunes played by his children. The former boss of Kingfisher and Debenhams is now angling for what would arguably be his biggest job yet: chairman of the BT board. The unexpected resignation of Jan du Plessis earlier this month, which came amid   with chief executive Philip Jansen, has left a tantilising opportunity. “It’s not a state secret that I will put my hand up,” he says. “If there’s an opportunity for me to do it, brilliant.” Despite being favourite within the City for the job, Cheshire is not counting his chickens. “As many of my more charitable friends have pointed out, the last four chairmen have all come from outside. So my chances are not necessarily that great, but I think it’s always good to have an internal option.” He is certainly talking like a leader, however. BT is at an “extraordinary inflection point”, Cheshire says. Regulator Ofcom is allowing the FTSE 100 company   to fund the rollout of full fibre broadband, the recent auction for 5G spectrum was , and he is hopeful that its gigantic retirement fund – which has so often weighed on BT’s valuation – is in a better position. “Suddenly a lot of the headwinds that BT has had are getting resolved,” he adds. Last summer Cheshire handed over the reins as the Government’s lead non-executive director to Lord Nash after five years in the job. Prior to that he spent four years advising the Department for Work and Pensions. He remains one of the Government’s “go-to” figures to lead high profile initiatives. In December he was asked to chair the £600m Sports Winter Survival Package to protect major spectator sports, for instance. As someone who has been privy to Whitehall decision-making for so long, he is well-placed to assess how Boris Johnson’s administration dealt with the health crisis. “[A] pandemic was always on the risk registers of all the departments, including the Cabinet Office,” he says. “I think what was misunderstood was the nature of the pandemic. It was a case of preparing for the flu when it was actually [more similar to] SARS. “There’s always the danger that you fight the last war, or you fight the wrong war. And I think this didn’t become clear early enough. So we prepped, and there was lots of war-gaming, [but] it just wasn’t necessarily for the right thing.” Cheshire also highlights the Government’s well-documented reticence to introduce restrictions at the beginning of the crisis. Ministers will “have to lock down much more aggressively” if and when a future pandemic hits Britain. Speaking in front of his great grandparents’ Welsh dresser, Cheshire steps out for a moment to deal with questions from workmen that are redecorating his office. His wife Kate is out, volunteering by driving people to get their Covid vaccination. He has no complaints on Johnson’s immunisation rollout. The vaccination programme has been “spectacular”, he says. “What was just striking was the willingness to commit early to invest.” Given his background in the retail sector, Cheshire is dismayed at the damage Covid has done to Britain’s high streets. Some of the country’s best-known names have gone to the wall during the pandemic, not least  , the department store he chaired for three years before being ousted by Sports Direct tycoon Mike Ashley in 2019. He has long been a critic of the high rents retailers have had to pay and believes the worst is yet to come for commercial landlords. “I started shutting bricks and mortar stores when I arrived at B&Q in 2005,” he says. “I was confronted with these 35-year leases. I was left thinking: ‘how the hell do you get out of a 35-year lease?’ ... If I had a store that wasn’t making money, I couldn’t get out of it.” Cheshire continues: “If on the other hand, the lease was ending, I could close it.” Landlords would then re-let the space for significantly less than B&Q was paying, he argues. “I could never get my head around this disconnect where the property market does start to react, but it’s on the bits that become vacant. “The UK is quite unique to have these long leases – in France they are much shorter, in the US they are much shorter – and that creates this overhang in the market and [landlords] won’t admit that the property is worth less. Everyone is sort of in this ‘delay and pray’ type territory.” Debenhams could have been saved before the pandemic, Cheshire says. But that required landlords to accept that just 50 of its 170 stores were profitable enough to stay open. “We couldn’t persuade the landlords to do the real change that was needed,” he says. The standoff and being locked into multi-year bank loans, left Debenhams “in a sort of zombie loop”. Having stepped down as Barclays UK chairman in January, Cheshire has been able to dedicate more of his time to promoting sustainable farming and food production – a passion that he has had ever since returning to the Borneo rainforest on holiday as a teenager. Cheshire was knighted in 2014 for services to business, sustainability and the environment. And he now wants the prime minister to set up a dedicated bank to support “agroecology”, which advocates the use of green technologies, eliminating the need for synthetic fertilisers and pesticides. It also promotes increasing the amount of land dedicated for ponds, hedges and meadows. Cheshire insists he is not campaigning for a taxpayer handout. “There are limits to what the private sector can do to help kickstart change,” he says. “It is very difficult to go green if you are in the red.”"
business,,,,,"Thirteen years after an unknown computer programmer posted a nine-page document to an obscure internet mailing list, the identity of Bitcoin’s creator remains a mystery. Many have tried to identify  , the pseudonymous author of the Bitcoin white paper, but none have succeeded. The untouched pile of Bitcoins in the individual’s online wallet,   (£36bn) at today’s prices, has led many to assume that he or she is no longer alive. But if Satoshi’s identity is a mystery, their original intentions for Bitcoin are very clear. The paper called the digital currency a “peer-to-peer electronic cash system”, designed to allow online commerce without fees or interference from financial institutions, enabling “microtransactions” that could unlock new online businesses. It was a noble goal in 2008 and remains one today. Even in 2021, money does not move around the world as easily as megabytes do, particularly when crossing borders. But Bitcoin has not delivered on its original promise. For evidence of this, we only need to look at the circumstances under which the digital currency was embraced by Tesla,  . The electric car maker last month revealed that it was converting a $1.5bn ($1.1bn) chunk of its corporate Treasury into Bitcoin, and then last week started accepting the online money as payment for its vehicles – as long as buyers are willing to shoulder a huge amount of personal risk. Tesla’s terms and conditions document for buying a car in Bitcoin is a revealing insight into its limitations as a method of exchange. The document makes liberal use of daunting all-capitals warnings, telling users to “PLEASE EXERCISE CARE WHEN INPUTTING THE CORRECT BITCOIN PRICE… BECAUSE BITCOIN TRANSACTIONS CANNOT BE REVERSED” and adds that “YOUR BITCOIN MAY BE IRRETRIEVABLY LOST OR DESTROYED”. Buyers who qualify for a refund are told they have no right to choose whether this is made in Bitcoin or dollars – effectively granting Tesla all the upside should the cryptocurrency’s price swing wildly (as it often does). They are also warned that Bitcoin’s lethargic processing times mean it may take a day or more for payments to be recognised, an uncomfortable thought for people handing over tens of thousands of dollars for a new car. One imagines most people will stick to a credit card. We should not take Tesla’s new fondness for Bitcoin too seriously. It has more value as a marketing stunt than a new sales channel. But it does usefully demonstrate the absurdity of actually buying anything with Bitcoin: the digital currency has none of the protections or reliability that most people rely on when sending money back and forth. This is the moment at which Bitcoin’s backers will point out that I am missing the point; that its value is as an inflation-fighting asset, not a currency: digital gold, rather than digital dollars. On the available evidence, this is hard to argue with. Bitcoin has so far proven to be a tremendous investment, one with enough lasting power to infuriate its crustiest critics and repeatedly shake off bubble warnings. A £100 investment five years ago would be worth £14,000 today. Its price has increased almost tenfold in the last year alone, to around $54,000 a coin. Dismissing it entirely now seems foolish: the sheer number of backers alone is enough to suggest Bitcoin will stick around. But the fact that we spend so much time focused on Bitcoin’s price itself gives away the truth: it has few other important qualities. Certainly few people today are using it as a payment method – they are too invested in its price rising to actually spend any of it. The latest craze surrounding cryptocurrencies is a mania for   (NFTs), unique virtual items such as digital artworks that, in theory, use the underlying blockchain infrastructure to guarantee their authenticity. Some NFTs  , life-changing sums for the artists involved. But interest in them appears to be the result of a combination of novelty and cryptocurrency millionaires looking for ways to spend their funds, rather than any substantial shift in the online economics of media. At this point, it is hard to argue that Bitcoin has lived up to its mysterious inventor’s early intentions as a world-changing financial protocol. Instead, from today’s vantage point the most significant impact of Bitcoin’s rise (beyond the   due to the tremendous computing power involved) has simply been to make a relatively small number of early adopters extremely rich. Good for them, but can we at least do away with the lofty talk of democratising finance? The answer is that, of course, we can’t. Accepting that Bitcoin is anything other than a once-in-a-generation change, the moment that finance entered the internet age, would spoil the illusion. Perhaps that illusion still has some way to run. The $1 trillion worth of Bitcoin in circulation remains only a fraction of gold’s value, so if it does become a store of value, you may still get rich if you buy it today. But let’s not pretend there is much more to it than that. Bitcoin’s price may be high, but its value is questionable."

Sunak cuts tax on Scottish flights to bolster the Union
","
Air passenger duty on long-haul flights will be increased to pay for a cut in the levy on domestic routes
",Oliver Gill,"
23 March 2021 • 5:46pm
","Rishi Sunak has announced plans to cut taxes for flights to Scotland to boost the “social cohesion of the Union”. A reduction in domestic   will be paid for by an increase in the tax imposed on long-haul flights - prompting criticism from the owner of British Airways.  Plans being considered include only charging air passenger duty one-way for domestic flights - previously outlawed when the UK was still in the EU - or introducing a lower band for domestic flights. “Domestic connectivity is a central pillar of the Government’s commitment to supporting the Union and  ,” a consultation published by the Treasury stated. “Domestic connectivity is vital in fostering integration between all parts of the UK and increasing the social cohesion of the Union. Travel by road or rail is not always practical for certain journeys within the UK, and it is important our domestic air network enables those who live in the UK to connect to areas that are otherwise hard to reach.” Aviation levies have been split into two bands: flights to destinations up to 2,000 miles away, and flights travelling more than that distance.  An economy flight from London and Edinburgh with easyJet costs less than £50, for instance. Of this, £13 - more than a quarter of the overall price - is air passenger duty.  Jonathan Hinkles, boss of regional airline Loganair, said: ""We are heartened to see the consultation around the promised changes to air passenger duty, which cannot come a moment too soon for domestic air travel.   ""The ability to make the change is one of very few benefits for the aviation industry from Brexit and it will help to address the significant loss of connectivity throughout all parts of the UK caused by APD."" While the move will be welcomed by some short-haul carriers, it will come as a blow to airlines such as BA that make bigger profits running long-haul services. A spokesman for BA owner IAG said: ""We have always said that APD should be abolished. Given the acute pressure on business, the hike in international APD will make it even harder for UK firms to trade overseas. This is a tax on Global Britain. We will be submitting our views in due course."" Long-haul travel has been hardest hit by the pandemic, with experts predicting that it will be the slowest to recover to pre-pandemic levels.  The Treasury is consulting on proposals to increase the amount of air passenger duty on long-haul flights by doubling the number of bands to four and introducing a frequent flyer levy.  Charging long-haul passengers more were part of what ministers called the “polluter pays principle”.  The consultation read: “Those who travel furthest internationally, and consequently have the greatest impact on the environment, [should] incur the most APD.”"
business,,,,,"Why all the fuss about  , now again the subject of fierce debate north of the border as we approach May’s Holyrood elections? Is not Scotland already essentially an independent nation; to finally cut the Gordian knot is only to formally recognise a pre-existing disposition. It might also save the rest of the UK a great deal of money. That’s too flippant a way of looking at things, no doubt, but the Scottish government certainly behaves as if it is running an entirely independent country, an impression further underpinned by the pandemic, where Scotland maintains a largely independent containment policy. Call it devolution if you like, but from the outside, it looks like much more. Across multiple fronts, public policy is now so completely divergent from the rest of the UK that Scotland might as well be fully sovereign. So divergent, in fact, that you begin to wonder whether it is not the first minister, Nicola Sturgeon, rather than Boris Johnson, who these days calls the shots for the union as a whole. Her offer of a  , snuck out on the very eve of pre-election purdah - a vote buying initiative if ever there was one - has had the real Prime Minister down in Westminster scurrying off shamefacedly to reconsider his stingy  . How is it, you may well ask,  , but unaffordable down south, which to the extent that anywhere in the UK these days generates a fiscal surplus is where it tends to occur? It’s called the Barnett formula, after the former Labour chief secretary to the Treasury, Joe Barnett, and it works like this. Every year, the budget of the devolved administrations is set by taking the previous year’s spending and adding a pro rata share of whatever increase there has been for the UK as a whole. Last financial year, the Barnett block grant to Scotland amounted to £32bn. The effect is that historic differences in spending are preserved in aspic regardless of whether any longer justified. A further distortion arises because Scotland’s population has been shrinking relative to England’s, which boosts nominal spending per head over time - such that it is today more than 20pc higher than England. As it is, the only parts of the UK that in normal times generate a fiscal surplus - in the sense that they raise more in tax than they spend - are London, the South East and East England. Everywhere else spends more than they raise in tax. For Scotland, the shortfall in 2019 was £2,482 per head. Actually, this is not particularly high by the standards of some UK regions. For instance, the North East spends £4,064 per head more than it raises in tax, according to the latest ONS data. But here’s the point. Scotland is by no means a poor part of the UK; actually, average earnings are roughly the same as the UK as a whole. It follows that Scotland’s per capita contribution to tax revenues is also roughly the same. Scotland’s slightly higher top rates of income tax make only a marginal difference. Revenues from North Sea oil have also ceased to offer much by way of the offset once claimed for them by Scottish separatists. In any case, if you want to know why Scotland can “afford” free higher education, free social care, free prescriptions, a 4pc pay rise for healthcare workers, and all the rest, but England can’t, ask the late Joe Barnett. It is also why the Scottish National Party opposes anything by way of meaningful reform. They know a good thing when they see one. Despite the distortions, they will not be backing the “needs based” system sometimes proposed by way of a fairer alternative. The UK Government also guaranteed continuation of the Barnett formula when campaigning against Scottish independence in the 2014 referendum. We tamper with it at the union’s peril. Indeed, the only way it could plausibly be changed is ironically via a vote for independence in the second referendum Sturgeon threatens to demand should she win an overall majority in the  . Personally, I doubt those ambitions have been as badly damaged by   over who knew what and when as imagined, even with the split in the nationalist vote threatened by Salmond’s new political party. All the same, for Boris Johnson the spat is like a gift from the gods, confirming his reputation as the luckiest of generals. Brexit seemed to doom him to the ignominy of being the Tory Prime Minister who took us out of Europe’s common market only to lose the union.  Exquisitely, the sight of the Scottish National Party tearing itself limb from limb over a matter that nobody could quite understand beyond the evident visceral hatred the participants have for one another, like clansmen fighting in a field, seems to have come to his rescue. Unwise to bet on it quite yet, though. The emotional pull of independence remains a mighty powerful one. This despite the fact that far from easing since the last referendum, the economic challenges of actually implementing a fully independent Scotland have steepened yet further, such that they today seem almost insurmountable. The question of who pays refuses to go away. Given the EU’s almost existential difficulties right now, Europe is not going to be exactly rushing to fill the vacuum in Scotland’s finances left by removal of the English teet. Some part of the shortfall could be met by cancelling Scotland’s share of UK defence spending, yet that would only further undermine the economy by rendering the country’s role as a major UK defence contractor and home to Britain’s independent nuclear deterrent obsolete. Even if Scotland is forgiven its share of Britain’s national debt - a degree of magnanimous generosity rarely seen before when countries go their separate ways (though interestingly, it is what eventually happened in the case of the Republic of Ireland) - massive tax hikes and spending cuts would be required to put Scotland’s public finances on a sustainable footing. For a country that still feels badly wronged by years of Tory austerity, that’s quite an ask. A plausible answer over what to do about the currency has also yet been proposed. Sterlingisation is no kind of a solution; just think what would have happened to Scotland with no lender of last resort to bankroll the emergency expenditure that has been required by Covid. On its own account, Holyrood would have found credit impossible to access. The fact is that the unsatisfactory nature of today’s settlement suits Sturgeon’s Scottish nationalists rather better than they care to admit, sustained in power as they are by the largesse of the Barnett formula and the unfulfilled dream of independence. The challenges of the real thing would very likely finish them off."

The flawed technologies behind vaccine passports

In the race to create a passports app, experts warn we could be placing our privacy and security at risk
",James Cook,"
30 March 2021 • 6:00am
"," are supposed to be our ticket to freedom, providing a much longed for route to normality after the tedium of lockdown.  Countries around the world are now   to underpin them, with the UK due to launch its Covid 'certification' review in early April. But in the race to create a passports app, experts warn we could be placing our privacy and security at risk.  “Although it supplies a short-term fix, the long-term issues are potentially dangerous unless they are fully looked after now,” warns Jake Moore, a cybersecurity specialist at ESET. Security researchers point to the troubled launch of   as a key example of what should be avoided. The country’s “green pass” app, which has been in use since February, allows those who have already had Covid-19, or who have been vaccinated, to visit places such as gyms and restaurants by presenting a code. However, the app was quickly found to have potential security issues because it was built using outdated computer code. The initial version of the app also sent feedback to the personal email address of an employee of the country’s Ministry of Health. Israel’s green pass system relies on a central, government-run database that stores and checks all vaccination data. The system is an inspiration for Boris Johnson, who publicly announced his intention to develop a replica app days after Israel's software launched.  ""This is an area where we're looking at a novelty for our country, we haven't had stuff like this before, we've never thought in terms of having something that you have to show to go to a pub or a theatre,"" he said. However, experts warn that relying on one centralised system could produce issues with everyone’s personal information kept in one place - an attractive target for hackers. “Part of the problem in Israel is that they've got this central database,” says Peter Yapp, a partner at law firm Schillings who previously worked at the National Cyber Security Centre, a division of GCHQ. “They have also used some encryption which is not necessarily top notch encryption, so might be vulnerable. They've done it very quickly.” A better option, experts say, would be to rely on a decentralised database as the UK ended up doing for contact tracing   that kept information on people’s phones instead of a central server. “The privacy angle on all of this is it's far worse on a centralised database because you don't know where that data is going to sit, how secure that data is going to be and who that data is going to be shared with,” Yapp says. However, . A system that relies on people’s devices to store data will likely be much trickier to develop than simply having an entire NHS database with information on who has and who has not been vaccinated, and which can then grant companies access to that data. The debate is not just around how the data will be stored, but also how venues or restaurants will be able to verify the data they’re receiving. Many of the systems being designed rely on QR codes that people can have on their smartphones or on physical cards. Venues would be able to scan people’s QR code, which would then provide them with information on whether someone had received a vaccination or had a negative Covid-19 test. But, says VST Enterprise boss Louis-James Davis, there are huge pitfalls to relying on such technology.  “There's many different ways that you can hack a QR code,” he says. One of the most popular methods used by fraudsters is something known as “attagging”, where valid QR codes are replaced with cloned ones created by bad actors that then redirects those scanning the codes to websites where their data can be breached. “That's what a lot of the fraud in the world is at the moment,” Davis says.  It is not just fraudsters who may look to exploit loopholes. For many Britons, desperate to get back to normality, there may be the temptation to try to get around systems, Davis adds. “If QR codes were used for the pub vaccine passports, one person could have a genuine vaccine passport, and all his friends could clone it and they could go to the pub together”.  Some companies are looking at different methods of verifying vaccinations. For instance, iProov and Mvine are working on a government-backed project which would remove the need for each individual venue to independently check information, and instead could require customers to just look into a camera and have the systems use facial recognition to verify that they have the medical requirements to enter. Yet, these too are mired with controversy. Privacy advocates Big Brother Watch warns that schemes relying on biometric data are particularly worrying because “facial recognition algorithms suffer from inaccuracy and have particular issues accurately recognising women and people of colour”.  “Such apps would be likely to compound discrimination issues and may wrongly obstruct individuals from enjoying their rights and freedoms.” What’s more, privacy experts are becoming increasingly concerned about how much data is stored on individuals and for how long. “Legally speaking it is data related to health and as such it attracts an additional layer of protection under the law which means that it can only be used for very, very specific purposes with your consent,” says Eduardo Ustaran, a partner at Hogan Lovells. The Government’s  only stored data for 21 days before it was deleted from people’s phones. But vaccine information could need to be stored for at least a year, increasing the risk that the data could be misused. “The more data we hand over, the risks surrounding data misuse increases,” Moore says. “In a world where personal data is now firmly the currency of choice for large companies and criminals alike, we need to be thinking long and hard about what personally identifiable information we give away as well as to whom we share it with.” His worry is that a centralised database could be forgotten about in years when the pandemic is over, resulting in a potential bonanza for any cybercriminals who manage to break into it. There’s also the worrying potential of falsified vaccine data, with criminals already selling fake vaccine certificates for as little as $150 online. “Not everybody will like to take the Covid-19 vaccine and we provide proof of having been vaccinated,” the online listing for the faked document read. As attractive as vaccine passports may be, it’s clear that governments and software companies face significant work to overcome their flaws in the coming months. The fiasco around the development of a contact tracing system in the UK, where the country spent months last year developing its own system before scrapping it and switching to another built by technology giants, should provide some lessons. If experts aren't consulted straight away, then the development of a major vaccine passport scheme in the UK risks being another expensive folly."
business,,,,,"The pitter-patter of tiny   feet has been even harder to hear in Italy over the past 12 months after the pandemic struck a nation already bearing the sorry label of Europe’s biggest demographic disaster zone. At the end of last year, births plunged by almost 22pc across 15 Italian cities nine months on from the beginning of the lockdown. If Auguste Comte’s famous dictum that “demographics is destiny” is any guide, it spells more bad news for a country which already has the highest share of over-65s in Europe, at 22.8pc.  Italy’s total fertility rate has been   to stand at 1.3 births per woman, far below the 2.1 “replacement rate” to replenish population, absent migration. Early in the pandemic, more than a third of couples abandoned plans to procreate, and Guiseppe Conte’s administration turned to bribes in a bid to turn the demographic supertanker last June with plans for monthly payments of up to €240 (£205) for new mothers under a new Family Act. On this side of the Channel the fertility rate is higher, standing at almost 1.7 in England and Wales in 2018. But there are enough warning signs for ministers to be concerned about slipping into an Italian-style trap.  The latest comes from Southampton University’s Centre for Population Change, which weighs up a myriad of factors such as 200,000 delayed weddings, frustrated chances to socialise and economic uncertainty. It comes up with a worst case scenario of 66,000 fewer children born in 2023 if the previous   is combined with a . It estimates that the fertility rate already slipped below the previous lows of 1977 and 2001 to just 1.6 in 2020 – but could fall even closer to Italian levels by 2023 at 1.45. Idiosyncrasies have deepened the Italian problem, such as much lower female participation in the workforce, which is linked to lower fertility. In a traditionally Catholic country fewer Italian children are born outside of marriage and they live in the family home for longer. Meanwhile economic uncertainty and a lack of job opportunities prompted almost 160,000 Italians to emigrate in 2018: some 21,000 chose to come here.  But there are also similarities which should strike a worrying chord in the UK, such as a patchy and expensive childcare system and a decade-long hangover from the financial crisis which is hampering the ability of young people to “transition” into adulthood and start families. Since 2000, for example, the share of British 20-34 year olds living at home has risen from 20pc to 26pc, with almost a million more people now living with their parents. While the UK does not share Italy’s cultural ties to the family home, the story is more about affordability following a decade of virtually stagnant pay for younger cohorts now entering what is supposed to be their demographic prime.  The Institute for Fiscal Studies pointed out in 2019 that the age group that had done worse since the financial crisis were those in their 30s, who emerged into the jobs market in the 20s in the immediate aftermath of the recession and are still suffering average earnings 7pc below the pre-crisis level for their age. The average age of first-time buyers in the property market has  , and research shows the rise of the private rented sector is bad news for fertility as parents are exposed to the greater uncertainty it brings such as the unsettling effect of potentially being forced to move their offspring around schools.  Other ingredients in this unappetising demographic dish include the impact of ultra-loose monetary policy since 2009 which has sent cash into assets like homes in a search for yield due to ultra low interest rates. That has pushed up prices along with the Government’s , fuelling a scarcely interrupted jamboree for housebuilders since George Osborne introduced the scheme in 2013.  The result of these myriad factors is that the very age group which we would usually expect to do the population “heavy lifting” (so to speak) has been the biggest economic victim of the past few years.  This requires some hard and radical thinking from ministers, especially as lower immigration acts as another handbrake. The previous all-time low for fertility was in 2001, on the cusp of a wave of immigration from the European Union accession countries; whatever the societal implications of the influx ahead of the Brexit vote, the arrival of younger workers was a boon for population growth.  The Migration Advisory Committee modelled what happened in 2004 against the Labour Government’s original more restrictive proposals and found the overall population would have been more than 3pc smaller with a similar drop in overall output. Following Covid, the population tailwind has partially reversed with more than 180,000   in the past year, according to the Office for National Statistics. Some estimates put the UK’s population fall as high as 1.3m in the past 12 months.  Migration is likely to be permanently lower under the points system, so the Government needs to pull supply side levers. Its mortgage guarantee scheme for first time buyers risks exacerbating the affordability problem if it simply encourages demand without impetus to supply. Conservative backbench opposition to last year’s planning White Paper was depressingly predictable, but speeding up the delivery of affordable new homes is probably the best hope for prising young people away from the parental hearth and getting on to making babies. The CPC’s demographics professor Ann Berrington suggests “small cash benefits” for would-be parents are unlikely to work: the Government instead needs to look at a range of more family friendly policies and more generous subsidies for childcare, where the UK ranks among the most expensive in the world according to the OECD. Boris Johnson has looked after the old, through lockdown – and through the preservation of the pension “triple lock” – but now he needs to offer something to the young. Labour data shows young people bearing almost two-thirds of the fall in employment since the pandemic struck: the danger is the same sorry saga of the financial crisis will be played out again, and the UK will follow Italy further down a barren path."

business,,,,,"Emmanuel Macron has lost control of the  . Germany placed the country on its high risk alert on Friday. It is only a matter of hours or days before the UK follows with its red card.  “We’re going straight into the wall,” warned Catherine Hill,  of French epidemiologists. “We’re already saturated and it’s become totally untenable. We can no longer take in non-Covid patients, it is completely mad.” Prof Hill told   that   is nothing less than a “death strategy”.  The deepening crisis is sufficiently serious to alter the character of the next French election and to delay reopening until the middle of the year, inflicting another quarter of economic damage. Mr Macron’s political survival is no longer assured. His inner circle are lashing out wildly. Forty medical directors from the Paris public health system (AP-HP) warned over the weekend that they are facing a “medical catastrophe” as critical care beds run out. They are preparing to pick which patients to save, evoking the fateful term ‘triage’ that sends shudders through the ruling   party. It is what happened in Bergamo a year ago when Italy was caught by surprise. There is less political excuse for letting happen a year on. “It is an Airbus A320 crashing every day. Is it legitimate for a country like France to accept that,” asked François Salachas, a neurologist at   hospital in Paris. Daily cases are running above 40,000 and are still rising. Mr Macron is vulnerable. He made a ‘Jupiterian’  , defying calls for a lockdown from the scientific council and key ministers. He argued that the cost-benefit calculus no longer justified stripping people of their freedoms. Any action had to be weighed against the psychological costs and the mounting economic damage. He enjoyed a bounce in the polls. The Elysee knew by then from regional intelligence reports by the prefets that French public consent for stop-go lockdowns was breaking down. Compliance could not be assured. Mr Macron imposed a 6pm curfew - a bizarre policy that concentrated shoppers into a short time window after work - and tried to muddle through with partial measures and technocrat tinkering. The next week will determine whether the consequence is a manageable ordeal or utter disaster.  “There won’t be a mea culpa from me. I have no remorse and won’t acknowledge failure,” said Mr Macron in a tense exchange with journalists on Thursday night. “We were right not to implement a lockdown at the end of January because we didn’t have the explosion of cases that every model predicted.”  The contrast with   (in her case for wanting an Easter lockdown, almost certainly correctly) could hardly be sharper. It plays to the least attractive side of his political persona: the arrogant  who always insists he knows best. France has been edging crabwise into a hybrid lockdown for several weeks, with greater Paris and 19 departments under strict constraint already. Mr Macron will not let this be called a lockdown. It is dubbed the ‘third way’. “Emmanuel Macron, who has a habit of dodging responsibility, refuses to recognise the failure of his bet in January and won’t impose the necessary measures,” said the Paris magazine  . “How do you qualify a government that cooly lets 300 of its citizens die every day when it can be avoided? While our British neighbours (belatedly) faced up to the problem and opted for a drastic lockdown, the French government has just watched passively,” it said.  The term ‘bet’ was an infelicitous choice and is coming back to haunt him as opposition parties go in for the kill. The strategy might have been plausible if France had begun vaccinating earlier and rolled out jabs more quickly, but vital weeks were wasted and Mr Macron himself encouraged the anti-vaxxers by trying to undermine the credibility of AstraZeneca. There is now a systematic attempt by his entourage to blame the unfolding debacle on the British, trying to create a sense that everything would be on track were it not for the UK’s refusal to hand over  . Foreign minister Jean-Yves Le Drian accused the UK of holding Europe to ransom over vaccines, a revealing use of language that psychologists would call transference. “The United Kingdom has taken great pride in vaccinating well with the first dose except they have a problem with the second dose. One can't play with blackmail,” he said. This was a thinly-veiled threat to cut off supplies of the second dose of the Pfizer vaccine produced by the Americans in Belgium with lipid nanoparticles from the UK.  The water has by now been muddied to the point of total confusion, as appears to be the purpose. The   was orchestrated by the EU internal market commissioner Thierry Breton as a publicity stunt. It aimed to create an impression, without saying so categorically, that Britain is obtaining its AstraZeneca doses from plants located in the EU. It is not true. If it were true, it would not have prevented the third wave of Covid from exploding. Millions of unused AstraZeneca vaccines were piling up in French fridges in early and mid March. Such a diversionary campaign is unlikely to work. The French media site Atlantico called it “pathetic”.   accused the government of squalid populism. “Short-term demagoguery has prevailed, and we will pay a high price,” it said. Social media are on the warpath calling for criminal prosecution of French political figures deemed responsible. Mr Macron’s policy of delay has allowed the South African and Brasilian variants to top 10pc of cases in nine French departments, reaching 36pc in Moselle, 18pc in the Dordogne, and 16pc in the Vosges. Elisabeth Borne, the labour minister, has been hospitalised with the South African variant. She called it a nightmare. “You have the feeling your whole body is going haywire,” she told  Antibody protection from the Pfizer, Moderna and AstraZeneca vaccines, or from prior infections, is limited against this variant. This leaves Downing Street with almost choice: it will have to impose the red list regime, even if this disrupts freight haulage through Dover. The French economy will ultimately weather this saga. Mr Macron has handled the economic side of Covid relatively well. Fiscal support has been generous and reliable from the outset, keeping investment alive and lessening the risk of permanent scarring. But hopes of 6pc growth this year are perishing. An Easter crisis lasting through April and into May implies another quarter of recession.  The debt ratio will be even higher when the country finally recovers, punching well through 120pc of GDP. This matters because the French structural deficit is the largest of the eurozone bloc. There is no self-corrective mechanism as the growth cycle revives. The day when rating agencies finally react to this fundamental rot in the public finances is drawing closer. Whether Mr Macron survives this ordeal is an open question. His brand is technocrat competence. Without that, little remains. He faces a credible challenge in the centre ground from Xavier Bertand, the president of Hauts-de-France, which may split the vote in the first round of next year’s election. The rush of events over the last week has abruptly raised the possibility that Marine Le Pen will sweep into power as dynastic leader of the eurosceptic right. In the meantime, Angela Merkel’s Christian Democrats   as vaccine paralysis reshuffles the German political pack, opening the way for a left-leaning coalition led by a Green chancellor.  “All changed, utterly changed,” to misquote W.B.Yeats. The European political order as we know it may soon be over."

Sir Richard said: ""Virgin Galactic spaceships are built specifically to deliver a new, transforming perspective to the thousands of people who will soon be able to experience the wonder of space for themselves. ""As a SpaceShip III class of vehicle, Imagine is not just beautiful to look at, but represents Virgin Galactic's growing fleet of spaceships. ""All great achievements, creations and changes start with an idea. ""Our hope is for all those who travel to space to return with fresh perspectives and new ideas that will bring positive change to our planet."" The craft's outer panelling is designed to reflect the surrounding environment, meaning the craft will change colour as it travels from Earth and into space. Virgin Galactic's space craft are built to be carried to high altitude under a fixed wing, dual fuselage aircraft. From there, they are dropped before rocket boosters kick in and carry them into the upper atmosphere. Sir Richard's company has been pursuing the goal of space tourism since 2004, but still has yet to complete a paid passenger flight to the edge of outer space. Its current space plane, VSS Unity, reached the very edge of space at more than 51 miles high, but has not crossed the ""Karman Line"", roughly 62 miles high, considered by many to be the start of space proper. Its next manned flight is planned for May. The venture is known for a major set back in 2014, when one of its first vehicles, VSS Enterprise, crashed killing its co-pilot. Virgin Galactic said the third generation of spaceships was ""built to enable improved performance in terms of maintenance access and flight rate"". It added the VSS Imagine had a more efficient design, which would allow it to scale up production.  As the new ship is ground-tested, Virgin Galactic will progress the manufacturing of another third generation vehicle, VSS Inspire. The company said it is targeting 400 flights per year, per spaceport, as part of a multi-year effort. Tourist flights are expected to cost $250,000. Michael Colglazier, chief executive of  Galactic, said: ""Today we unveiled our SpaceShip III class of vehicles, marking the beginning of the Virgin Galactic fleet. ""VSS Imagine and Inspire are stunning ships that will take our future astronauts on an incredible voyage to space, and their names reflect the aspirational nature of human spaceflight. ""Congratulations to our dedicated team who worked so brilliantly to achieve this milestone."""

Satellite mega-constellations are making our night skies 10pc brighter
","
It comes as companies including SpaceX and OneWeb race to put internet satellites into orbit

","The growing   and space debris around Earth's orbit is making our night skies around 10pc brighter, according to new research.  Scientists based at institutions in Slovakia, Spain and the US, modelled the contribution of space objects, including satellites from the likes of SpaceX and OneWeb, to the overall brightness of the night sky. They found that a significant increase in the diffuse brightness of the night sky, potentially obscuring sights such as the glowing clouds of stars in the Milky Way, Miroslav Kocifaj, a senior researcher at the Slovak Academy of Sciences, who was the study's lead author, said the results were ""extremely surprising"". ""We expected the sky brightness increase would be marginal,"" she said. Instead Kocifaj and her team found the thousands of satellites currently in orbit risked creating light pollution in large parts of the planet, threatening astronomers' research.  ""Unlike ground-based light pollution, this kind of artificial light in the night sky can be seen across a large part of the Earth's surface,"" said John Barentine, a co-author and also Director of Public Policy for the International Dark-Sky Association.  ""Astronomers build observatories far from city lights to seek dark skies, but this form of light pollution has a much larger geographical reach."" The number of satellites in orbit is set to increase dramatically over the next few years. Elon Musk's SpaceX now has more than 1,300 Starlink satellites in orbit and has applied for permission to launch a total of 42,000. OneWeb has almost 150, with plans for its first-generation constellation to reach 648 within the next year. The company has also filed a request with the US Federal Communications Commission, seeking permission to later take that total to 6,372.    Astronomers have already expressed concern about satellites' ""staining"" effect on their view of space, posting videos online of their their telescopes interrupted by white stripes across the sky.  In November, scientists warned that the exponential number of satellites being sent into orbit risked “cutting us off from the cosmos” for good. There has also been concern about the growing number of ""mega constellations"", which see fleets of satellites launched into space to improve global telecommunications coverage. However satellites are considered key to giving rural areas broadband access. Earlier this month, the UK Government has held talks with Elon Musk’s satellite network Starlink over  In response to light pollution concerns, SpaceX said it would introduce a software upgrade so satellites would fly ""knife-edge"" to the sun in order to minimise reflections. But American astronomers are not convinced, particularly as other companies, including OneWeb, plan to launch similar mega-constellations. “If there are lots and lots of bright moving objects in the sky, it tremendously complicates our job,” James Lowenthal, an astronomer at Smith College, told The New York Times. “It potentially threatens the science of astronomy itself.” SpaceX and OneWeb did not reply to requests for comment on the latest study."

Japan's biggest bank faces $300m hit from Archegos selloff

Mitsubishi UFJ Financial's warning of potential losses follows similar statements from Nomura and Credit Suisse
",Bloomberg News,"
30 March 2021 • 1:34pm
","Japan's biggest bank is the latest lender embroiled in the unwinding of bets by Bill Hwang’s Archegos Capital Management. Mitsubishi UFJ Financial's warning of a potential $300m (£218m) loss related to a US client is linked to the firm that failed to meet margin calls last week, according to a source. Nomura, another Japanese bank, and Credit Suisse have both warned of “significant” losses in the wake of the Archegos unwinding, which hit US stock markets on Monday. MUFG’s securities arm said it was evaluating the extent of the loss at its European subsidiary, which may change depending on market prices and the unwinding of transactions. Any loss would not have a material impact on the company and a spokesman declined to comment further. Lenders are just starting to tally the carnage after the forced liquidation of more than $20bn of positions linked to Hwang’s New York-based family office hit shares including Baidu and ViacomCBS, casting a spotlight on the opaque world of leveraged trading strategies. A loss of $300m could badly dent MUFG’s European securities operations. The firm’s London-based subsidiary, MUFG Securities EMEA, posted a profit of just £84m in 2019, according to the most recent results filed with Companies House. Mitsubishi UFJ Securities reported pre-tax profits from the region of about 17bn yen (£112m) for the nine months to December, a presentation showed. Nomura, Japan’s biggest brokerage, said on Monday it had an estimated $2bn claim against a US client, which Bloomberg identified as Archegos. The Japanese firm has begun assessing the cause of the possible loss tied to a US client and it is too early to say how it might affect profits, an insider said. Shares of Nomura fell again on Tuesday after dropping a record 16pc on Monday. Wall Street banks grappling with the implosion of Mr Hwang’s investment firm briefed US regulators as Washington started to dig into one of the biggest fund blowups in years. The Securities and Exchange Commission summoned the banks for hasty meetings on what triggered the forced sale of stocks linked to Archegos, according to insiders. Goldman Sachs said the impact on its financial results was likely to be immaterial, as did Deutsche Bank. Morgan Stanley, another big player that was still trying to sell blocks of stock as late as Sunday night, has yet to specify any toll."

Londoners risk tax raid as Sadiq Khan faces Tube funding crisis 
","
Analysts predict passenger numbers will permanently fall by a fifth as the pandemic changes travel habits forever
",Oliver Gill,"
29 March 2021 • 7:09pm
","Londoners are expected to face a massive tax raid as Sadiq Khan scrambles to protect the city's transport network from a long-term plunge in commuting. Demand for buses, underground and rail services will never return to pre-pandemic levels, according to a bleak report from credit agency Moody's - a trend that risks crippling the finances of   (TfL). Analysts have predicted that passenger numbers will permanently fall by a fifth as the pandemic changes travel habits forever and legions of commuters embrace home working. A leading transport academic said that Mr Khan, who is mayor of London and TfL’s chairman, is most likely to impose new taxes to fill the hole. Meanwhile London's transport commissioner Andy Byford said that relying on fare income to fund the capital's public transport is ""not sustainable"". TfL will be hit far worse financially from the change than its peers in New York, Paris and Vancouver, Moody’s said. The London authority is forecast to lose more than 12pc of its operating revenue. This compares with revenue falls of less than 8pc across the other three cities, despite a similar drop in passenger numbers. Bosses at TfL are locked in talks with the Government over a long-term bailout deal worth £15.8bn.   more than £3bn to keep services running in the capital over the last year. Sadiq Khan has   to plug the shortfall unless he is given permission to retain road tax collected in the capital. Both options have been rejected by  , who said earlier this year: “I don’t think he can simply raid the national budget."" With City Hall and Westminster unable to agree a deal before a pre-election communications blackout began last week, Mr Shapps offered a seven-week extension to the current central Government funding that runs out on Mar 31. Mr Khan, the odds-on favourite to be re-elected for another four years in May, regularly clashed with Boris Johnson over the parlous state of TfL’s finances last year. The Prime Minister said Mr Khan had bankrupted TfL’s finances. In response, the mayor - who froze fares for four years from 2016 - said Mr Johnson’s remarks were a “blatant lie”. Tony Travers from the London School of Economics outlined a number of options to put TfL back on firmer financial footing. He said: “The most likely is some kind of permanent tax fix that would need to be found."" Mr Travers said that another option is a substantial cut to services, but added that cutting public transport would be at odds with the Government’s climate change commitments to reduce car use. A third option to increase fares more steeply would also be at odds with the country's green ambitions. Mr Johnson is   amid concerns that handing subsidies to London will undermine his pledge to level up the economy. TfL is more vulnerable to a fall in passenger numbers compared with its overseas counterparts because of its dependency on fare income. More than 70pc of the authority's costs typically come from fares. This compares to around 35pc in New York and Paris, which fund services through local taxes and central budgets. Mr Byford warned last summer that long-term funding from taxpayers outside of London will be required to wean the capital's public transport network off its dependence on fares. On Monday he added: ""The last year has shown that TfL’s current reliance on fares revenue as a primary source of income is just not sustainable and needs to be fundamentally changed to drive a robust recovery and thriving future. ""An effective transport network, investing for the future, is absolutely critical to the safe and successful recovery from the pandemic of London and the UK as a whole.""     Moody’s predicted that passenger numbers will be 40pc lower than pre-pandemic levels in the current fiscal year and will settle 20pc lower permanently.   Analyst Zoe Jankel said: “The shift to remote working, coupled with the increased use of online leisure and retail services, will lower demand and permanently reduce fare revenues.”"

London risks house price crunch as Covid boom ends
","
Prices could fall when the stamp duty holiday comes to a close
",Tim Wallace,"
30 March 2021 • 6:00am
","London is poised to lead a national crunch in house prices as Covid and the stamp duty holiday risk pushing the market up to unsustainable levels, top economists have warned. The pandemic sparked the  , but the housing market was spared the expected slump by unprecedented measures to prop up incomes, via furlough, and support property sales with a tax cut. When help from the Government disappears, the postponed slump threatens to take hold, according to academics at the London School of Economics’ Centre for Economic Performance. “There is a significant risk of policy trying to prop up house price growth. The implemented policies –  – are costly to the Government and eventually are likely to be reversed,” said the report, written by Paul Cheshire, Christian Hilber and Olivier Schöni. “If this coincides with an economic downturn there is a significant risk that the policy ends up triggering a housing market downturn, reinforcing the economic downturn.” London is particularly vulnerable because the price of houses, as opposed to flats, rose particularly sharply over 2020, while the population of the capital is estimated to have fallen sharply as foreign workers appear to have left in the pandemic. “Together with the fact that the stamp duty holiday disproportionately   and housing markets, we would therefore expect the historically unusual situation of a housing market downturn more substantial in London and the South East than in most other parts of the UK. Not a levelling up, so much as a dressing down,” said the economists. Overall national property prices in December were 8.5pc higher than they were a year earlier, according to the Office for National Statistics, marking the most rapid increase since 2016. By region this growth ranges between 3.5pc in London and 11.2pc in the north west of England. There is still room for another surge depending on policy supports. “All that said, the extensions of the Furlough scheme and the Stamp Duty holiday and the reincarnation of the first iteration of Help to Buy, announced in the Budget, and the ‘innovation’ of   into the British mortgage market, may quite possibly spark yet another temporary spurt in prices, before the downturn eventually takes effect,” the report said. The economists have not estimated the likely extent of the crunch, but note that in the late 1980s a combination of tax changes followed by a recession led to a price boom followed by a crash in which house prices fell 30pc. After any crunch, the capital should also rebound. “London will recover from this crisis as it has so many times before. These superstar cities like London that are very diverse tend to do very well in the long-run,” said Professor Hilber. “This is really a short-run effect that might be quite pronounced, then the economy will recover.” A Treasury spokesperson said:“The temporary stamp duty cut is helping to protect hundreds of thousands of jobs which rely on the property market by stimulating economic activity. “Official HMRC figures show it’s working, with transactions up almost 50pc last month compared with February 2020.”"

","Britain was  as Boris Johnson led the first coronavirus briefing in the recently refurbished space.  The refurbishments for the televised press conferences cost £2.6 million,  . Writing in the Telegraph,   and lacks the sophistication, elegance or sense of history of the old room. Is the new press room an improvement, or a misuse of funds? Telegraph readers are no strangers to an honest and frank opinion and they’ve not held back in their assessments of the latest Downing Street refurbishment. Read on for the best discussion points from our readers and share your own view in the comments section at the bottom of this article. ""Sack the designer. This is no reflection of the ornate rooms that are befitting of the briefing’s importance. It is almost as if it has been lifted from a well-known hotel chain that rents out its rooms for presentations. Very poor from the government.""  ""There is absolutely nothing wrong with the new room. It looks functional and most importantly, there seems to be more room for journalists. It is also much cleaner looking than the old room."" ""Tasteless, vulgar and cheap. It deserves to be called out and mocked for what it is – a sad attempt at gravitas and ostentation.""  ""I could have done all that with a couple of noughts knocked off the end. It is also a poor choice of font for the lecterns – dated and styleless.  ""But my main beef is that it's aping the White House. Couldn't we have done something more 'Cool Britannia' for our new independent nation?"" ""What's this going to cost the NHS in vision problems? It literally hurts to look at. Good thing those lecterns say 'Downing Street' and the flags are Union ones otherwise I'd think it was America. This is so embarrassing. The old room was lovely, there was absolutely no need to change it. ""Please don't think I'm denigrating our flag, which I love and would gladly die for. But so many other things represent our nation as well and the quiet, nothing-to-prove look of the old room was one of them. Something only we can do. Any other country can do this look, and many do. The flags look really cheap and synthetic as well which I find disrespectful. ""I'm truly sorry if I've offended anyone who likes the new decor. But we fought so hard to get out of the EU and now we've given up something uniquely English at a price we can't afford."" ""That blue background has got to go. Get it replaced with some wood panelling made from native trees from the four nations. Put it out to tender and pick a top-level cabinet maker as opposed to a firm. He will produce real craftsmanship for a few thousand. ""In any event, once another party forms the government it will want to change the colour to its party colour, as blue is identified with the Conservatives."" ""All of a sudden we're interior design consultants. Now we are no longer economists during Brexit and or epidemiologists during Covid we turn our hand to trashing an understated, functional and perfectly adequate press centre merely because the flags don't have an elegant plinth. No doubt the detractors here would have been just as noisy if it had been presented in Baroque, Rococo or minimalist Scandinavian style.  ""I have no doubt much of the expense would have been in providing the attendant press corps with an effective, adequate and secure communication system."" ""How can this sum of money have been spent on one room? It might seem like a drop in the ocean compared to the vast sums spent on the pandemic but to put it into context that would build a great many houses."" ""It looks like a school hall stage with blue felt nailed on the wall. Even charging one million would have been eye-wateringly expensive for that. ""I'm a big fan of the flags, though."" ""Rather dreadful, cheap (in appearance at least) and a nasty dated design. Very lacklustre and it all looks totally temporary, including the ""pulpit lecterns"". Even the flags are on freestanding pedestals so it all resembles something quickly jammed together like the sort of temporary stuff you get at exhibitions. Surely it didn't cost all that massive amount?"" ""It's so identical to the background Biden speaks in front of, not to mention the crest on the podium, it almost looks like parody. I'll give my next vote to the first party who promises to rip out the blazing blue and replace it with soothing wood panelling. And I realise politicians don't like journalists but surely they could have given them more comfy-looking chairs."" ""Nearly all of the money in a media studio is spent on the computerised innards of the system and the endless wires which squirm unseen under the floors to bring the pictures of Boris Johnson into our living rooms. ""It's a bargain, given that the workings of the system have to be faultless and not apt to break down."" ""I suppose they decided to carve the letters into the lectern so they couldn’t fall off. Honestly, the other room was far better. There was a sense of history and purpose in the old room that this just doesn’t allow for."" ""I think it looks great, the striking blue backdrop with two huge Union Flags either side of the lectern. It gives the impression of a Prime Minister who is proud of his country and that we are a country of substance. No longer made to feel ashamed to be British, but proud to be British which the silent majority in this country most definitely is."" ""The wood, on the door and panels, doesn’t even begin to match. The blue on the walls clashes horribly. Why did they use an obviously colour-blind designer?"" ""My goodness! Surely someone could have mentioned a slightly more subtle blue would be kinder on the nation's tele-worn eyes.  ""The wood panelling in the old room had class. A new carpet and it would have been job done.""  ""The whole point of flags is that they are flown outside, isn't it? The giant flags that flank the Prime Minister look garish and out of place. The fact that the government feels the need to remind people of their loyalties is a bit of an over compensation, but then do any of us really know what Britishness stands for any more?""

","MPs could be banned from Parliament's bars and restaurants if they break the code of conduct under new plans to make punishments for rule-breaking more strict. A report by Parliament's Standards Committee, published on Tuesday, recommends that MPs who break rules are subject to a wider range of sanctions including the removal of ""services""  . The committee also suggests introducing a distinction between sanctions that affect the core functions of a member and those that do not. MPs have been working on proposals to modernise the current system and ""fine-tune"" its confidentiality arrangements in the ""interests of fairness to all concerned"". Chris Bryant, who chairs the committee, said the recommendations would ""give teeth"" to a standards system ""that everyone in the Parliamentary community can be proud of"". ""For too long, the only sanctions available against MPs have been a slap on the wrist or suspension from the House,"" Mr Bryant said. ""The reality is that breaches of conduct are rarely black and white, and so the sanctions in such cases shouldn't be either."" The most serious penalties, including suspension from the Commons, would remain. An earlier version of the proposals suggested that MPs who break the rules should be sent on   which could include sessions on equality and diversity and anger management. The plans for mandatory courses   after Jacob Rees-Mogg, the Leader of the Commons, said the training was ""generally more effective when undertaken with consent and when it is not just viewed as a punishment"". But if an MP refuses to attend a training course it could be viewed as ""a factor aggravating the original offence"" under the plans. MPs have previously refused to attend   in Parliament, which were laid on for all parliamentary staff. Ben Bradley, a Tory MP, said he was ""not convinced"" it would make ""the blindest bit of difference"" and called the sessions ""deeply undemocratic"". Tuesday's report also recommends that Parliament's independent grievance body should be allowed to issue statements to the media if complaints about MPs have been inaccurately reported. The plans will be tabled in Parliament and voted on by MPs."

Covid lockdown roadmap: the key dates for when restrictions will end and what rules will change
","
Boris Johnson has set out a four-step exit from the current lockdown - here's what happens next
","Ben Riley-Smith, ","
30 March 2021 • 11:20am
"," - as part of the roadmap out of lockdown, the stay-at-home rule ended and the rule of six returned in England. These measures are part of the four key steps over four months to bring the UK completely out of lockdown. The plans are an attempt to kick-start the British economy and ease the societal pressures of lockdown without triggering a dangerous resurgence of the virus. The roadmap is underpinned by four key “tests” that are linked to data, which will act like a checklist that must be met before moving onto the next step of reopening. The four tests will determine whether:   is going as planned; vaccines are effective in bringing down deaths and hospitalisations;  are not rising so fast that the NHS risks being overwhelmed;   do not create unforeseen risks. Another big change is the scrapping of tiers, to be replaced with ""steps"".  Step one, part one applied to all of England from Monday, March 8, with the second part from  . Regions will enter step two no earlier than Apr 12, and step three no earlier than May 17.   Step four, which will come into force no earlier than Jun 21, should see ""all legal limits on social contact"" lifted.  The Prime Minister said it was thanks to the UK public ""that we can continue on our road map to freedom"". He said: ""We will meet our targets, offering a first dose to everyone over 50 by the middle of next month, as well as those under 50 who are clinically vulnerable, and offering a first dose of a vaccine to every adult by the end of July. It comes as the Coronavirus Act was extended by another six months on Mar 25, despite being   The legislation gives far-reaching lockdown powers to close ports, ban protests and detain citizens to late September, despite Mr Johnson being ""hopeful"" there will be a lifting of restrictions on Jun 21. Additionally, the ongoing dispute with the EU over a   has cast some uncertainty on the future of the vaccine rollout in the UK. As of Mar 29, a total of 30,444,829 people have received one dose of the vaccine, with just over 3.6m having received both jabs. Completing inoculation of the nearly 30m Britons between doses is the government's current priority moving forward. Matt Hancock, the Health Secretary, said on Mar 18 that   will have ""no impact on the road map"" out of lockdown, a statement which was later reiterated by the Prime Minister. The third test has triggered early debate, because rising cases alone will not be enough to stop reopening. That will happen only if rising cases risk overwhelming hospitals. The four steps are separated five weeks apart. That leaves four weeks to monitor the impact of the preceding step and one week to give people notice. The reopening is designed to happen uniformly across England, so there is no return to the tier system. Below are the four steps of the roadmap. The dates are the earliest dates at which the next step could happen, with delays possible if the data takes a negative turn.  The first step, which began on Mar 8, is split into two sections, initially focusing on getting   again and reuniting families who have spent so long kept apart. All schools in England, both primary and secondary, have now reopened, with   in schools and at home.  Pupils are expected to wear face masks in the opening weeks. However, students will not be forced to wear face coverings in classrooms, as some will be ""anxious and nervous"" about wearing them, children's minister Vicky Ford has said.  School sports have also returned, both indoor and outdoor, so pupils of all ages can get back to playing football and doing PE lessons. Schools can set their own rules. ‘Wraparound’ childcare is allowed to resume, which means after school sports and extra curricular clubs can take place.  There were also  on Mar 8. Residents are now allowed to have a single visitor, and that individual can visit repeated times rather than the trip being a one-off. The visitor and care home resident will be allowed to hold hands, but other close contact is not allowed. The visitor must get a Covid-19 test beforehand and wear protective equipment. The outdoor socialising rules have changed in the second section of reopening. From March 29, six people from six different households were allowed to meet outside, meaning the so-called ‘rule of six’ returned. Alternatively, two households could also meet outside. This means two families, who potentially together total more than six people, are allowed to meet. This can happen in both outdoor public spaces and in back gardens.  has been dropped, similarly the Government has dropped its “stay local” messaging, meaning that households are no longer explicitly told to remain in their geographical area.  While people will still be encouraged to minimise travel, there will not be punishments for someone who drives a few hours for a meet-up outside, then returns that day.  Outdoor organised sports for both adults and children will also return. Outdoor swimming pools, driving and shooting ranges, riding arenas at riding centres, archery venues and climbing walls are also allowed to open. So too outdoor gyms. The return of team sports can only happen in formalised settings, meaning that five-a-side football matches are allowed but a dozen friends kicking a ball in a park is not. Indoor sports will still be off limits. Also the sports must be organised, so a large group of people cannot gather to kick around a football if it breaks the number limits explained above.  will be allowed to open from Apr 12, if the data allows. People may be urged to only go in alone rather than as an entire household. Retailers will be as the Government seeks to bolster the high street and ensure compliance with social distancing rules.   can open again from the same date, but only outside, so pub gardens and outdoor dining will be back. Groups can gather, but with the same limits as above: either up to six people or two households.  There will be no curfews or any requirement to serve a meal with alcohol, removing the  Pubs will be allowed to serve takeaway pints.  Boris Johnson indicated on Mar 24 that   when they reopen later this year. However, Mr Johnson said it may not be feasible to implement the plans until everyone has been offered a vaccine, after publicans criticised his plans. The Prime Minister said on Mar 25 that the Government will say more on their possible use in early April, and suggested they could also be based on whether  , as well as vaccinations and negative tests. Staycations will be allowed, in a limited form. One household will be allowed to stay overnight somewhere in the UK, but not with another household. ‘Self-contained accommodation’ will be available to rent, so for example cottages or Airbnb rentals or campsites. However hotels and B&Bs cannot reopen. Hairdressers and nail salons will be allowed to open.  Outdoor hospitality venues like zoos and theme parks can also open. The limit on the maximum number of attendees at weddings and wakes will also rise from six to 15. There will be no change for funerals, to which 30 attendees are already allowed. Gyms can also open but you cannot attend with people outside of your household, because indoor socialising is barred at this point. Gym classes are not yet allowed. From May 17, groups of up to six people and two households will be allowed to meet indoors, so people can enter each other's homes from now.  The Health Secretary, Matt Hancock, stated on Feb 23 that  , although people must remain ""cautious"" until this date.  Pubs and restaurants can open indoors. It is unlikely there will be strict requirements on capacity, but it must be table service. Hotels and B&Bs can open in step three,as can indoor sports and gym classes. Entertainment venues can open too, including cinemas and theatres. New rules will be in place for different sizes of venues. Normal outdoor events can open for up to 4,000 people or 50 per cent of the venue capacity, whichever is smaller.  Similarly normal indoor events can open for up to 1,000 people or 50 per cent capacity, again whichever is lower. For huge outdoor seated venues there is a special limit. Up to 10,000 attendees will be allowed or 25 per cent capacity, whichever is lower.  This means, for example, Wembley Stadium will be able to open with 10,000 fans attending. Oliver Dowden, the Culture Secretary, said that coronavirus ""certificates"", were being considered as a way of getting people back to larger events ""in significant numbers"" from Jun 21. ""We're piloting the different things that will enable that to happen - clearly it will have to be done in a Covid-secure way"", he said. ""You would expect, and we will be testing these things, things like one-way systems, things like masks, things like hand hygiene and everything else. ""Another thing that we are considering is a Covid certification, and we will be testing whether we can use Covid certification to help facilitate the return of sports."" Weddings, receptions, wakes, funerals, and other life events like Bar mitzvahs and christenings will be allowed to be attended by up to 30 people. This will be as close to normal as possible. There will be no attendance limits on weddings and funerals. Big venues that were unable to open last year, such as nightclubs, can finally reopen. Many of the details for what can happen now is dependent on a number of reviews. There are four reviews that have been commissioned that sit below the roadmap. They are designed to find answers that right now the Government feels it cannot give. Each has a ‘complete by now’ date, meaning we know when to expect clarity but not what the review will decide or if it will lead to a change in the rules. One review is looking at international travel. It will see whether with vaccine certificates and testing the border can be more open than it is now. This must conclude before step three on May 17 but could report back in April. That means - theoretically at least - the borders could be relaxed in time for summer holidays. However there is no guarantee the current rules, which bar anyone from travelling overseas for holiday, will be lifted after the review, meaning summer holidays abroad are not guaranteed. It comes as Boris Johnson confirmed that the UK’s holiday roadmap will be unveiled on April 5. The Government’s Global Travel Taskforce was expected to report on April 12, but at a Government press conference on Mar 28 Mr Johnson confirmed the announcement will be made one week earlier than planned , with further detail to be given on April 12. However, the Prime Minister had said earlier on Mar 23 that the prospect of holidays looked ""difficult"", due to coronavirus cases rising in other European countries.  New regulations that passed with the review of coronavirus restrictions on Mar 25 include a provision to ban leaving the United Kingdom ""without a reasonable excuse"", meaning those leaving the UK without a valid reason could face a £5,000 fine. Exemptions include work, volunteering, studying, elite sports, legal obligations, medical reasons, care and assistance to vulnerable person, wedding of a close family member - but   going on holiday. Matt Hancock confirmed in an interview with   on Mar 23 that this policy will come into force in the week of Mar 28. A scientist advising the Government has warned that the prospect of foreign holidays this summer looks ""extremely unlikely"". Dr Mike Tildesley, a member of the Spi-M modelling group, said there was a danger travellers could bring back new variants of the coronavirus - like that which emerged in South Africa - which are less susceptible to vaccines. ""I think we are running a real risk if we do start to have lots of people going overseas in July and August because of the potential for bringing more of these new variants back into the country"", he told the BBC Radio 4 Today programme on Mar 20. ""What is really dangerous is if we jeopardise our vaccination campaign by having these variants where the vaccines don't work as effectively spreading more rapidly."" A second review will look at social distancing measures. These include the keeping of two metres apart outside (or ‘one metre-plus’ inside), wearing face masks and being encouraged to work from home. That review is due to report back before stage four, which is Jun 17. In other words, do not expect to be told to go back to work in an office until the summer at the earliest. A third review will look at Covid vaccine certificates being used domestically. This is interesting as Government ministers had previously played down that possibility.  understands that   could be introduced at theatres, football matches, business conferences, wedding venues and  . The Prime Minister has confirmed that Michael Gove has tasked in  , in which the ""deep and complex issues"" surrounding the introduction of immunity certificates will be examined. Boris Johnson skirted the issue on Mar 24, stating that the use of vaccine passports in pubs may be up to the discretion of individual landlords. It is understood that the Government remains concerned about the implications of such steps and will weigh moral and ethical implications of any moves like this. It will report back by step four, which is Jun 17. The fourth review will look at large events. It will attempt to work out when it is safe for large events to be held again. It too will report back by step four, so Jun 17. Pilots for big outdoor events will be allowed to take place from April."

Independence risks economic havoc for Scots
","
Seccession would slash income per capita in Scotland by as much as 8.7pc, experts warn, dwarfing the hit from Brexit
",Louis Ashworth,"
28 March 2021 • 4:00pm
","Until the early 18th century, crossing the border between Scotland and England meant entering a lawless territory plagued by raiders, livestock rustlers and an assortment of other ne’er do wells – who, in the phrasing of William Wordsworth, would “prey alike on two distracted countries”. Small forts, walled homesteads and pele towers still litter the landscape with reminders of that blood-soaked age. Thankfully, after more than three hundred years of political union, things are a lot simpler: travellers are more likely to be greeted by a Saltire sign reading   (welcome to Scotland) – or, coming the other way, the signs of the Northumberland or Cumbria county councils – than a freebooter. But political strife threatens to return. May’s elections could trigger a major push for a  , just seven years after “once in a generation” plebiscite. The SNP is polling around 50pc and is expected to demand a new vote if it wins a  . Yet much has changed since last time. Economically and financially there have been three main shifts: Brexit, a Covid-enforced boom in debt and a global plunge in oil prices. All make the prospect of independence significantly more challenging. The SNP’s long-standing policy, championed by Nicola Surgeon, is for an independent Scotland to  . But analysis suggests taking such a step too quickly could have devastating consequences. Scotland’s economy is hugely open, with imports and exports each equivalent to around 60pc of its GDP. The country trades about three to four times as much with the rest of the UK as it does with the EU. “The received wisdom sometimes in Scotland seems to be that because Brexit is bad, 'Scexit' and reversing leaving the EU would be good economically,” says David Phillips, associate director at the Institute for Fiscal Studies. “I am not sure that is true, certainly in the short to medium-term. “With a reasonably hard version of Brexit there is almost a choice – do you be part of the UK single market or the EU’s single market?” Trade modellers from the London Schools of Economics say seccession would eventually slash income per capita in Scotland by as much as 8.7pc, dwarfing Brexit’s anticipated long-term hit of 2pc. Rejoining the EU would “do little to mitigate the costs of Scottish independence”, according to these experts, shaving the fall only slightly to between 6.3pc and 7.6pc – and only in the long run. In the short term, they say that returning to the EU would be   than remaining in a common market with England, Wales and Northern Ireland. The modellers point to a paradox in the economic argument for leaving the UK and joining European bloc. “For an independent Scotland to be better off inside the EU, independence must destroy a sufficiently large share of Scotland’s trade with the rest of the UK that the EU becomes Scotland’s most important trade partner,” they say. “For rejoining the EU to be economically desirable, independence itself must bring substantial economic costs.” Hanwei Huang, one of the report’s authors, says disentangling the Scottish economy would likely prove more complicated than Brexit. “It probably would depend on the future relationship between the UK and the EU,” he says. “For example, if the UK and EU has a closer relationship, probably it is more attractive for them to stay in the UK common market.” The dangers of an immediate re-entrance to the EU show how much the economic case for Scottish independence has weakened since 2014 – even before factors such as the recovery from Covid-19 are taken into account. Covid has given Britain its  . The national debt has surged by more than a third, from just under £1.5 trillion in 2014 to more than £2.1 trillion now. Working out how to split this bill, built up over centuries, will be politically fraught - and economically critical for a newly independent nation trying to win the confidence of international markets. In 2014 the Scottish Government suggested splitting it by “historic contribution” to the finances, arguing that since 1980 oil revenues meant Scotland has chipped in more than the rest of the country. This would result in Caledonia taking around 5pc of the national debt. Westminster argued this was spurious as extra spending also goes north. In addition, the sums change radically depending on the base year - counting only from 1990 to 2014 and Scotland’s share doubles to almost 10pc. That translates to either £105bn or £210bn. An alternative is to split the debt by share of the population. This would give an independent Scotland just over 8pc of the UK’s national debt, or around £170bn. Either way, investors who bought UK bonds will not see some morph into Scottish bonds. Instead, Scotland would pay the interest on the agreed share of the debt then potentially take some on as the bonds mature, depending on the deal. Meanwhile,  . In 2014 prices seemed permanently high, with fevered talk of Brent reaching $200 per barrel: ideal conditions to finance Scottish spending for years to come. But prices tumbled, dragging tax revenues from the North Sea to a small fraction of their old level. Investment has plunged, output is set to fall steadily and 2050 net zero emissions targets mean the energy source is out of favour altogether. A 2018 report from the Sustainable Growth Commission, established by the SNP, acknowledged the shift and suggested an independent Scotland should treat future oil and gas revenues as “windfalls” rather than a reliable basis for day to day budget planning. As things stand now, that day to day budget would be seriously in the red. Before the pandemic, Scottish tax revenues per capita were a touch lower than those in the UK as a whole, while spending was higher. Mairi Spowage at the University of Strathclyde’s Fraser of Allander Institute notes that this extra spend – some of it set by Westminster, but some, particularly on education and healthcare, decided in Holyrood – means Scotland typically runs a notional budget deficit around six percentage points bigger than the UK’s. In 2019-20 this came in at 8.6pc versus the UK’s 2.6pc. “They tell us little about the long-term sustainability of the public finances of an independent Scotland, because presumably there would be different choices made, different priorities and perhaps things that they would choose not to spend money on as well,” she says. As the Scottish Government puts it: “The whole point of independence is to give the Scottish Parliament all the economic levers it needs to grow our economy and to make the public spending choices best suited to Scotland’s interests – such as not spending hundreds of billions of pounds on the  .” Yet even trimming defence and UK-wide project spending would only cover around one-tenth of the deficit, according to Phillips. Financial markets might be willing to lend big sums at small interest rates through Covid, but they are unlikely to fund large deficits year in, year out. “At the moment, in effect, Scotland is able to slightly live beyond its means because of the fiscal transfers from the rest of the UK,” says Phillips. “Scotland could be a successful independent country, but it would have to fund its own public spending, rather than have some of it implicitly funded by transfers from the rest of the UK. “That would require some combination of tax rises, austerity and borrowing in the first decade at least of an independent Scotland.”"
business,,,,,"The pandemic is like a very long war. Over-confident early victors flag along the way. Chastened early losers regroup. Analysis by France Stratégie, an agency of the French state, strongly suggests that the UK is not the egregious disaster story that many supposed. As this revised narrative takes hold, it will greatly alter the post-Covid political landscape. The  shows that France, the UK, Belgium, and a handful of other countries have reported their death toll from Covid accurately – or even over-reported, as doctors in doubt put Covid on the certificate – while many others around the world have understated the true figures. Some have done so by massive margins. The UK is not an outlier after all, and early vaccination is improving the relative picture by the day. This is in spite of bad luck. The country was the laboratory of the B117 variant, before we realised how lethal and contagious it was. The French conclusions are no surprise. We already knew that the Worldometer is a distorted snapshot. What is a surprise is the exact breakdown of excess deaths across 71 countries. As of February 28, UK deaths were up 22.1pc since the pandemic began. This was lower than in the US, Russia, the whole of southern Europe, most of Eastern Europe, and the major countries of the Middle East. It is far lower than Latin America, where excess deaths average over 50pc. This rises to 107pc in Peru, despite its draconian lockdown (see chart below). On the other side of the ledger, Italy has declared 62pc of extra deaths, the Netherlands (69pc), the US (72pc), Austria (80pc), and Germany (85pc). This compares to the UK (97pc) and France (105pc). The picture across most of continental Europe is going to deteriorate further since the third wave is spinning out of control. Slow rollout and the double-dose rule on jabs mean that large numbers of people over the age of 75 are not yet protected. In a sense, this sort of league table is irrelevant. Each country has its own national tragedy. But the political fallout does matter. The final verdict when the dust settles will shape how this Government is viewed. It will soften the coming inquiry (up to a point). It chips away at the Scottish myth: the notion that Nicola Sturgeon handled Covid superbly while Boris Johnson stumbled from one blunder to another. It strips yet more varnish from the European story. It inevitably informs the mutual propaganda contest over Brexit. We can see in hindsight that the UK began the war on Covid much as it has begun almost every major war over recent centuries: half asleep, in utter shambles, with obsolete contingency plans. The first wave had echoes of the Norway campaign in 1940, or the great retreat of the British Expeditionary Force in August 1914. It always seems to take time for Britons to pull themselves together. Ultimately they do. By the end of the First World War, the British armed forces were arguably the best-run logistical machine on the planet. The cavalry invented the modern  in 1918. What is remarkable is how far the main Continental states have succumbed to policy fatigue and unforced errors. It is not just the vaccine debacle. Governments have refused to listen to their own scientists on the self-evident lag effects of B117 infection. The Robert Koch Institute warns that Germany is heading for 100,000 cases a day unless drastic action is taken immediately. No such action is happening. Chancellor Angela Merkel has threatened a constitutional power-grab to override the recalcitrant  , warning over the weekend that she would not stand idly by and let the virus run rampant. Saarland is planning to defy Berlin and reopen after Easter, even though the South African variant has reached 36pc of cases just across the French border in Moselle. It is much the same insouciance in Weimar, close to the unfolding disaster in Czechia. France’s Emmanuel Macron overruled his advisers in late January and refused to impose tougher measures, judging that the public would not stand for it. His political intuition was correct. The decision rescued his poll ratings. You can cast this as a courageous decision to resist pandemic hysteria and give proper weight to the larger social and economic issues at stake, or you can cast it as spinelessness, as the Paris magazine Marianne puts it. What is indisputable is that the strategy has allowed new variants to sweep the country. It has left France facing an explosion of cases and the saturation of ICU beds. French epidemiologist Catherine Hills calls it a “death strategy”. Mr Macron has banned the term “lockdown” but is being  , a step at a time. Forty medical directors from the Paris public health system (AP-HP) say they will have to begin triage, picking who will live, and who will die. Is this his political Sedan? Europe has by now blown the second quarter of 2021. Failure to act earlier will delay reopening by three months, prolong the lassitude that is already corroding societies, and wreck much of the tourist season for a second year. The economic damage can be exaggerated. Industry is humming. Countries have learned to muddle through with Covid. But nor should it be understated. The double-dip recession that began in late 2020 is storing up a cascade of insolvencies, to be let loose once temporary help expires and moratoria are lifted. “The longer the recovery takes, the greater the risk of economic scarring as investment is permanently lost and skills start to atrophy,” said Neil Shearing from Capital Economics. Mr Shearing said the US will regain its pre-pandemic levels of output by June. The eurozone will take a year longer. Spain will not recover until 2023. My bet is that the UK will record blistering growth this year, the “ ” recovery predicted by Andy Haldane at the Bank of England. If so, the OECD will have some trouble explaining why it forecast last Autumn that the British economy would be   over the course of 2021 while the eurozone raced ahead. That does not guarantee a sustained recovery, once the mechanical V-shaped jump fades. The real test comes later. But it does suggest that the global narrative on Brexit will be unrecognisable by next Christmas. I will make another soft bet, that Boris Johnson’s Conservatives will still be secure in power long after each of the dominant ruling parties in Germany, France, Spain, and Italy (sort of) are out of office and licking their wounds. As for the US, it is  . It has largely reopened already. The rebound is rocket-driven by a   that lifts total discretionary stimulus since last March to 25pc of GDP. The scale is comparable to Franklin Roosevelt’s war-time blitz from 1942 to 1943. The eurozone is a mirror image. It is months behind on herd immunity, and is therefore having to lock down again. Accumulated fiscal relief is roughly a third, falling to 4pc of GDP in Spain. Premature austerity will be avoided this time. There will be no repeat of the great post-Lehman blunder. The stabilizers will stay in place and fiscal deficits will remain as big as they were last year. But that is not the same as stimulus. It is needed to avert a negative feedback loop. The consequence of three extra months of recession will be to push sovereign debt ratios further beyond the point of no return (in a currency union) and further to widen the North-South gap, rendering the fundamental predicament of the Club Med bloc ever less tenable. In a sense, the worse it is now, the easier it is for the European Central Bank to keep soaking up debt issuance from semi-solvent states. This is the paradox of crisis. The reckoning is deferred. The problem turns serious once recovery begins and inflation starts to pick up. It will then become progressively harder for the ECB to justify quantitative easing. To persist at that point would be to cross legal and political lines. It would not be monetary policy under the Lisbon Treaty. It would be a fiscal bailout without democratic sanction. The markets presume that the ECB can and will do whatever it takes, for as long as it takes. One has to admire their touching faith in central banks."
politics,,,,,"The British Government’s handling of the pandemic has included many mistakes, but now it is at least partially redeemed by our  . By contrast, it is widely recognised even within the European Union that the bloc has handled vaccination  . It is tempting to believe this is a one-off but it isn’t. It fits in with an established pattern of bad EU decision-making. Moreover, it raises important questions about how the EU needs to change, as well as about how we can make a success of Brexit. In the 1960s when the UK was making overtures to join what we now call the EU, this tendency to make bad decisions was not by and large established. The one major exception was the Common Agricultural Policy (CAP), which we always knew was a colossal waste of money. Indeed, the prime motivating force behind the case for British membership was the realisation that our economic growth rate was lower than theirs. The combination of the size of the European market and what appeared to be their greater economic competence suggested that we would be more prosperous if we joined. The negative side to this argument was a suspicion that we British couldn’t run our economy properly, as evidenced by the record of relative decline, high inflation and appalling levels of industrial unrest. But over the next quarter century this pattern was reversed. During the Brexit referendum campaign in 2016, I was frequently asked how the economic costs and benefits would stack up if we left the Union. I started by doing the usual totting up of gains and losses from such things as leaving the Single Market and signing Free Trade Agreements with other countries. But I argued that the net benefit from these factors was not the most important issue at stake. The most important issue concerned governance - that is to say, how well our governing institutions made decisions and enacted policies. It was impossible to tell - then as now - what the next big challenge would turn out to be but I argued that, whatever it was, on all past form the EU would handle it badly. Then, out of the blue, came Covid. There’s an amusing parlour game that you can play with your friends and family: name a single area where the EU’s policy has been crowned with success. What about the Single Market? Yes, that’s probably the best answer. It has been a success, although much less so than EU propaganda would have you believe, as evidenced by the fact that the economies of the EU have performed relatively poorly against international competitors. So the Single Market cannot be that great (and, by the way, it was a British idea). To set against this there is a litany of failures, from the CAP and Common Fisheries Policy, through to the bungled formation of the euro without simultaneously establishing fiscal union, to the migration crisis of 2015. Common European defence policy? Don’t make me laugh. There isn’t one. The EU relies on the Americans. And now,  . What has been at the root of the EU’s tendency to make bad decisions and to embrace bad policies? We have to look to the way the EU’s institutions work and how the drive to weld the member countries together affects policy and practice. Perhaps the greatest source of weakness is the abiding presumption that the route to success lies with uniformity and harmonisation. There is so much evidence that success derives from competition and diversity – and that even includes competition between countries. Linked to this is an inherent exaggeration of the benefits of size. This was seen last year as the EU chose to take a common approach to securing vaccines, believing that they could benefit from the combined purchasing power of the bloc. Sometimes sheer size does bring benefits but they have to be offset against the advantages of flexibility and speed. Having made such a Horlicks of securing and distributing vaccines, presumably the EU has noticed that the country with the most successful rollout of a vaccine programme against covid  , whose economy is roughly the same size as Denmark’s. Officials also have an inclination to consider business as the enemy, and accordingly a tendency to over-regulate. Moreover, it is driven by the precautionary principle when pursuing its regulatory agenda across a broad front. The result is a poor record on innovation and slowness in adopting new technologies. The Union (and especially France)  . This had been kept in check partly by British influence. But not any more. Yet it would be quite wrong to conclude that the contrast between the EU’s handling of the vaccination programme and our own settles the question as to whether we were right to leave the EU. We still haven’t had long enough to demonstrate a new successful pattern of British decision-making outside the EU. Securing vaccine supplies and administering the rollout is merely a good start. So far, the signs for the future are not that good. One of the main arguments for leaving the EU was that we would be able to regulate ourselves better, without having to follow the precautionary principle and without having to dilute our own interests in favour of some melange of other countries. Yet the Government has been reluctant to pursue a regime of radical change to our regulatory regime. Simultaneously, it seems all too willing to embrace a future of much increased public spending and hence increased taxation that would put Britain towards the top end of the international league on these matters, alongside many EU members. The lesson is clear: the EU doesn’t work. If Britain is to succeed outside the Union there is no point in doing things the EU way. Divergence is the way forward. This goes far beyond the procurement and distribution of vaccines."

Woodford investors to miss out on bumper profits from Oxford Nanopore listing
","
The stock picker previously held a 12pc stake in the biotech company, which is set for a multibillion pound listing later this year
",Morgan Meaker,"
30 March 2021 • 2:42pm
","Investors in  's collapsed flagship fund are set to miss out on gains of almost £60m after biotech start-up Oxford Nanopore confirmed plans for a London listing.  The 16 year-old company, which  is currently valued at around £2.3bn, although it could be worth significantly more after the float. Jefferies put its estimated value at $5.4bn (£3.9bn). Mr Woodford held a 12pc stake in Oxford Nanopore prior to the collapse of his fund. Administrators have since been seeking to claw back cash for investors by selling down stakes. Last year Link Fund Solutions, which is handling the liquidation of the Woodford fund assets, sold its stake in Oxford Nanopore to US-based investor Acacia for just £20.8m. According to financial results for Acacia published on Tuesday, those shares are now worth $111m (£80m).  At its current value, the listing could make Gordon Sanghera, Oxford Nanopore's 60-year-old chief executive and co-founder, around £47m.   The company's two other co-founders Spike Willcocks and Hagan Bayley could make around £27.2m and £17.9m respectively, based on both ordinary and deferred shareholdings listed on Companies House. IP Group, the FTSE 250 intellectual property commercialisation specialist, also holds a 15pc stake in Oxford Nanopore and could gain £340.3m from the listing, it said. The Oxford-based company, founded in 2005 as a spin-out from the University of Oxford, has developed   that are being used to spot and track mutations of Covid-19 as well as other viruses. Since the pandemic began, the company's DNA tools have been used for a fifth of all   taking place around the world, and its technology has been adopted in 77 countries.  Mr Sanghera said 2020 had been a ""pivotal year"" for the company and a deeper pool of capital would fund further growth plans. ""We believe that there is huge potential for near-sample, rapid, low cost, sequencing-based analyses across scientific research, healthcare and industrial settings,"" he said.  ""These include the long-term potential to provide rapid biological insights in infectious disease, immune profiling and cancer, as well as in food safety, agriculture or other industrial environments."" The company said it was too early share any more information on what type of structure the listing might adopt. Analysts have suggested the company's valuation could land anywhere between £4.5bn and £16bn at an IPO. The decision to list in London will be seen as a win for the government, which has been trying to woo promising tech companies to prevent them fleeing to the US.  In December, Boris Johnson invited Oxford Nanopore along with bosses from other companies that were considering a float to Downing Street to discuss what would convince them to choose London. "

Tobacco giants forced to pay for cigarette butt cleanup

Companies say ministers have backtracked on plans for a voluntary scheme to discourage smokers from dropping cigarette butts
",Oliver Gill,"
30 March 2021 • 2:57pm
","The world’s biggest tobacco companies are fuming after being blindsided by ministers over plans to make them pay tens of millions of pounds to pick up cigarette butts. Environment minister Rebecca Pow said cigarette makers must be made “fully accountable for the unsightly scourge of litter created by their products”. Tobacco firms said that they had already voluntarily agreed to pay £50m to an environmental organisation that would aim to discourage smokers from dropping cigarette butts.  But with the money due to be handed over at the start of April, the Government instead decided a regulatory intervention was required to force them to pay for the clean-up.  Ms Pow said: “Cigarette butts are a blight on our communities, littering our streets or ending up washed down the drain and polluting our rivers and oceans. “We must all take action to protect our environment. We are committed to making sure that the tobacco industry plays its part."" Public health minister Jo Churchill added: “The environmental impact of smoking due to cigarette butt and package littering is still a major issue.” A spokesman for the Tobacco Manufacturers Association said: “Acting on the Minister’s instructions, the TMA and member companies entered into advanced discussions with an environmental organisation to support delivery of a multi-year, £50m programme of sustained consumer behaviour change and social impact activities to reduce tobacco-related litter. “The programme would be run independently of the industry, with the environmental organisation free to allocate funding for initiatives as it determines appropriate.  “We updated the minister about these plans in January and of our commitment to provide funding for the programme to start in April 2021. We are extremely surprised by this announcement today and will be seeking further clarification.”"

Amazon 'knew delivery drivers were urinating in bottles' despite claims to contrary
","
The internet giant had tweeted: “You don’t really believe the peeing in bottles thing, do you?”
",Nick Allen,"
26 March 2021 • 6:34pm
","Amazon was aware of drivers urinating in bottles and defecating in bags despite issuing a denial of the practice, according to leaked documents. The internet giant had denied on its official Twitter account that drivers were skipping restroom breaks as they sought to meet delivery targets. In a post on Amazon News it said: “You don’t really believe the peeing in bottles thing, do you?” But according to documents leaked to The Intercept managers were aware of the practice. An internal email from a logistics manager in May last year said: ""This evening, an associate discovered human faeces in an Amazon bag that was returned to station by a driver. ""This is the 3rd occasion in the last 2 months when bags have been returned to station with poop inside. ""We understand that DA’s [driver associates] may have emergencies while on-road, and especially during Covid DAs have struggled to find bathrooms while delivering. Regardless, DAs cannot, MUST NOT, return bags to station with poop inside."" The memo continued: “We’ve noticed an uptick recently of all kinds of unsanitary garbage being left inside bags: used masks, gloves, bottles of urine."" It called the behaviour by drivers ""unacceptable"" and said such incidents would be treated as ""infractions"". Another confidential internal document from January referred to “public urination” and “public defecation.” One employee told The Intercept: “Every single day of my shift I have to use the restroom in a bottle to finish my route on time.  This is so common that you’ll often find bottles from other drivers located under seats in the vans. The fact that Amazon would tweet that is hilarious."" The row over urinating in bottles began after Dave Clark, a senior Amazon executive, said the company was the “Bernie Sanders of employers, but that’s not quite right because we actually deliver a progressive workplace."" Mark Pocan, a Democrat US congressman from Wisconsin, responded: ""Paying workers $15/hr doesn't make you a 'progressive workplace' when you union-bust & make workers urinate in water bottles.” Amazon News then published its comments. It said: “You don’t really believe the peeing in bottles thing, do you? If that were true, nobody would work for us. ""The truth is that we have over a million incredible employees around the world who are proud of what they do, and have great wages and health care from day one."" Amazon employs around 1.3 million people around the globe. It also has contracts with hundreds of other companies to deliver packages, and many of the 400,000 drivers are working for separate firms, or are self-employed. Jeff Bezos, the Amazon founder, is the richest person in the world with a fortune of $179 billion, according to Bloomberg. The row came on the day Mr Sanders joined a unionisation effort by 5,800 Amazon workers at a warehouse in Alabama. It would be the first union on US soil at the massive technology company."
politics,,,,,"So it’s farewell and hello to Sir Antonio Pappano, 61, who will leave the Royal Opera House in July 2024, and two months later will reappear, phoenix-like, as the new chief conductor of the London Symphony Orchestra. And it’s bravo to the LSO, for snatching victory from the jaws of defeat. In recent months, things have looked gloomy for an orchestra that has always ridden high. Of all Britain’s orchestras, it is the one that comes closest to American-style glamour, with its big-stage spectaculars, its fabulous shiny sound, and its habit of bagging the biggest-name soloists and conductors – Previn, Davis, Tilson-Thomas, Mutter, Gergiev, Rattle. The pandemic, however, not only caused immense harm to the LSO’s finances – as with every other orchestra – but saw it suffer two further body-blows. One was the resignation of its current music director, Sir Simon Rattle, who pleaded a desire to be closer to his family in Berlin, but  . Then, last month, came the announcement that the Centre for Music, a proposed new concert hall and music-education centre where the LSO would have been resident,  . Rather than licking its wounds quietly, the orchestra has now seized the initiative by swooping on one of the world’s few bankable  . This new appointment is a brilliant move: it brings a new chief conductor who yields nothing to Rattle in terms of stature and authority, and whose confidence in front of television cameras, revealed by shows such as Opera Italia, will be an asset. Pappano is a very different musical personality to Rattle, more exuberantly warm in his nurturing of a long lyrical line, as opposed to Rattle’s inimitable combination of fastidious attention to sonority and visceral excitement. The only potential downside is that Pappano doesn’t share Rattle’s passion for new music, but this is a role the LSO’s impressive roster of guest conductors could take on. Will Pappano’s arrival bring a change of emphasis, perhaps more vocally-centred music? “Well, I have plenty of ideas for repertoire, I’m making copious lists,” Pappano tells me from Rome, where he’s been conducting a season of online concerts with the other institution he directs, the Accademia Nazionale di Santa Cecilia – a job he relinquishes in 2023.   “And yes, you’re right, I’m thinking about vocal music, but all these decisions are done in partnership with the orchestra so I can’t say anything yet. “If you feel a real chemistry with an orchestra, as I do with the LSO, that’s something you want to nurture and take care of,” he adds. “That’s not easy when you’ve got an opera house and another orchestra to run. So this shift to one orchestra, and to symphonic music, is a natural, organic thing.” "

","A former Brexit Party MEP has died in a diving accident, Nigel Farage has announced. Robert Rowland has been described as a “larger than life character” who was “enthusiastic” in his opposition to the European Union. The former politician and fund manager died yesterday near his family home in the Bahamas, according to a statement issued by Brexit Party founder Mr Farage. The Royal Bahamas Police Force reported that a man had been found on the seabed during a fishing trip aboard a 39-foot boat off the Caribbean islands on Saturday afternoon. A police report has stated that a member of the party spearfishing in the area of tourist destination Exuma Cays did not resurface. Mr Rowland represented the party as an MEP for South East England from 2019 until the constituency's abolition when the UK exited the EU on January 31 2020 “It is with great sadness that I have to announce the death of Robert Rowland, after a diving accident near his home in the Bahamas,” Mr Farage said in a statement through Brexit Party successor the Reform Party. “Following a successful career in the City, Robert was an enthusiastic Brexit Party MEP and larger than life character. “On behalf of myself, and all those who were involved with the Brexit Party, I extend our sincerest condolences to his family”. Mr Rowland was married to wife Lisa Marie, and had four children. Police on the island of New Providence in the Bahamas are investigating the incident After studying at Newcastle University, where he was first introduced to political activism, he worked in the financial sector with several asset management companies. He was elected with a number of colleagues in 2019 as Mr Farage's party won 29 seats in the European elections. Former Brexit Party colleague David Bull told the Daily Express: ""Robert was the kindest, most gentle, thoughtful friend. He was deliciously funny, dry, intelligent, erudite and compassionate. ""He was a huge support to me in the European Parliament and when I was campaigning in the General Election. “He was a true team player. We started as colleagues and ended up as the closest of friends.” Alongside his political activities Mr Rowland also supported Tickets for Troops, a military charity offering free tickets to music, sports, and entertainment events to members of the Armed Forces. The charity said in a statement:  “We are devastated to hear of the passing of Robert Rowland, a committed and generous board member to TFT. Our thoughts are with his wife, Lisa Marie and their children.”"

Mark Zuckerberg reveals he lets five-year-old daughter use Facebook Messenger Kids app
","
The Facebook chief insisted that its products are safe for children in his first testimony to the US Congress since January's violence
","Laurence Dodds, ","
26 March 2021 • 12:44am
","Facebook's chief executive Mark Zuckerberg has revealed that he lets his five-year-old daughter use the company's Messenger Kids app. Testifying before the US Congress, the 36-year-old founder said that he does not believe Facebook's products are harmful to children and defended its plan to launch a new version of Instagram for under-13s.  He also said that he frequently watches educational videos on YouTube Kids with his two daughters, aged three and five, but dodged a question about whether he had concerns about unsupervised smartphone use. The exchanges were part of a marathon five and a half hour hearing before the House of Representatives' commerce committee,   in January and their record on child safety.  Mr Zuckerberg said: ""My daughters are five and three, and they don't use our products. Actually, that's not exactly true – my eldest daughter Max, I let her use Messenger Kids sometimes to message her cousins."" He gave few details about Facebook plans, revealed last week by  , for a junior version of Instagram, which would officially expand its audience to children under 13 (who already sometimes use it by lying about their age). ""We're early in thinking through how this service would work,"" said Mr Zuckerberg. ""There is clearly a large number of people under the age of 13 who would want to use a service like Instagram; we currently do not allow them to do that... ""I think helping people stay connected with friends and learn about different content online is broadly positive. There are clearly issues that need to be thought through and worked out, including how parents can control the experience of kids."" He pitched the new app as a potential solution to the problem of under-age users, saying: ""If we create a safe system, [with] appropriate parent controls, we might be able to get people into using that instead."" However, he struggled to respond to accusations that Facebook does not do enough to catch under-age users as it stands and questions about how much money the company makes from adverts shown to them. Asked by Florida Democrat Kathy Castor if he was sure there were no under-13s on Instagram, he said only that they are not allowed. Ms Castor shot back: ""Of course every parent knows that there are kids under 13 on Instagram! And the problem is that you know it.""  in 2018 found that Facebook's moderators did not take action against suspected under-13s unless they admitted their real age, with one worker saying: ""We just pretend that we are blind and we don't know what under-age looks like."" Messenger Kids, which has a minimum age of four years old,   due to an ongoing impasse with the Irish Data Protection Commission about whether and how it can comply with EU data laws. Some committee members accused the tech bosses of seeking to monetise children's attention and asked in detail about their features and business models. Bill Johnson, a Republican representing Ohio, said they were ""essentially handing our children a lit cigarette and hoping they stay addicted for life"". Republicans largely abandoned their traditional questions about anti-conservative bias and free speech, focusing instead on child protection and young people's mental health. Sundar Pichai, the chief executive of Google and its subsidiary YouTube, admitted that YouTube Kids automatically plays a new video after the last has finished, a feature that has been criticised for aiding addictive behaviour and leading viewers towards extremist beliefs."

Lord Greaves, Lancashire Lib Dem who fought Paddy Ashdown all the way over deals with Labour – obituary
","
A fellow councillor described him as a force of political nature, and he brought a whiff of activism to the Lords
",Telegraph Obituaries,"
24 March 2021 • 3:59pm
","Lord Greaves, who has died suddenly aged 78, was a radical, independent-minded Yorkshireman who pioneered – from his base at Colne in Lancashire – the Liberal Party’s “community politics” which in the 1970s revived its fortunes in much of the country, A councillor in Colne for 42 years out of 50 until his death, Tony Greaves was a thorn in the side of party leaders from David Steel to Nick Clegg; it was Charles Kennedy who secured him a life peerage. Greaves was a leading dissident as Steel formed the Liberals’ alliance with the SDP, and broke with Steel’s drive for a merger after the 1987 election – though he soon became a Liberal Democrat himself. He was among the severest critics of  ’s efforts to develop close ties with New Labour. Ashdown described one party policy session in 1998 with Greaves at full throttle as “probably the worst meeting I have ever attended”. Greaves was convinced, from the outset, that Clegg’s coalition with David Cameron was a “bad idea”, saying no-one had had time to think the implications through. He stood for Parliament three times, but his strength was as a counterweight to Westminster. As secretary up to 1985 of the Association of Liberal Councillors, and subsequently the guru of local political activism, he was consistently suspicious of policies – and deals – hatched in London. In Colne, Greaves was respected across the party divide for his commitment to the town, and his encyclopaedic knowledge of the Pendle district. One fellow councillor described him as “a force of political nature”. Anthony Robert Greaves was born in Bradford on July 27 1942, the son of Geoffrey Greaves and the former Moyra Brookes. From Queen Elizabeth Grammar School, Wakefield, he read Geography at Hertford College, Oxford, then taught at Colne Grammar School. Greaves made his mark at the 1970 Liberal Assembly, introducing the motion that committed the party to “community politics” – campaigning on the doorstep to secure initially small improvements that mattered to local people. He served on Colne council (and its successor, Pendle) from 1971, and from 1973 to 1997 was also a county councillor. He fought Nelson & Colne at both 1974 elections, and Pendle in 1997. Editing the party magazine New Outlook, Greaves backed Steel for the leadership against John Pardoe. But he made Steel’s life uncomfortable as secretary of the Association of Liberal Councillors, then as a member of the party’s policy machinery who had started his own publishing house (he was later a second-hand book dealer). When Steel moved to merge with the SDP, Greaves was initially one of the Liberals’ negotiators – but pulled out of the team just before it concluded the infamous “dead parrot” policy document on the merger negotiations. From 2000 he brought to the Lords a whiff of social activism, and to the parliamentary party a resistance to reforms by Menzies Campbell and, subsequently, Clegg. In 2013 he aroused controversy by making light of accusations by four Lib Dem women of sexual harassment from his fellow Lib Dem Lord Rennard, writing: “We don’t know the details, but it is hardly an offence for one adult person to make fairly mild sexual advances to another. What matters is whether they are rebuffed. If the allegations as made are a matter for resignation, around a half of the male members of the Lords over 50 would probably not be seen again.” He later accused the complainants – who by then had left the party – of “a deliberate vendetta” against Rennard. Greaves was vice-president of the Local Government Association, and the Open Spaces Society. In 1988 he published, with Rachael Pitchford, Merger: the inside story. In 1968 Greaves married Heather Baxter, who survives him with their two daughters."

The mistake Remainers make about the British Empire

Sathnam Sanghera's new book Empireland is an eye-opening history – but it buys into a misleading Brexit myth
",Tim Stanley,"
31 January 2021 • 4:00pm
","Telegraph readers might be inclined to overlook Empireland because it’s praised on the cover by Lefty shock jock James O’Brien (death by endorsement) but, trust me, it’s better than that. The subject is timely. With statues being tossed in rivers and the  , it feels as if the Right regards the past as the repository of civilisation and the Left sees it as a closet packed with skeletons of dead racists, but the reality of the British Empire, says Sathnam Sanghera, was infinitely more complex. It was acquired, as Sir John Seeley famously described it, “in a fit of absence of mind”. Far from a coherent project, let alone a conspiracy, Sanghera calls it “unplanned” and “nebulous… it was never a legal entity, and had no constitution or emperor issuing top-down laws”. It was also controversial in its own time. When Robert Clive, the man credited with laying the foundations of the empire in India, died in 1774, he was buried in an unmarked grave; his crimes had been so great, said Samuel Johnson, that his conscience compelled him to cut his own throat. , now sitting in our museums, were recognised by contemporaries for what they were: booty. At the conclusion to the Mahdist War (1881-99) in East Africa, the Mahdi’s tomb was raided and his skull presented to Lord Kitchener as a gift, who toyed with turning it into an “ink stand or drinking cup” before depositing it with the College of Surgeons, an episode that Queen Victoria regarded as embarrassingly medieval. Throughout the 1846-7 Xhosa War in South Africa, “heads were taken and traded as souvenirs”. There were imperial projects of enlightenment and improvement, yes, and many Britons so fell in love with cultures they encountered that they “went native” – for good and ill. By the 1880s, almost half the British troops in parts of Bengal had an STD. One British officer, far from the embodiment of the “stiff upper lip”, attempted sexual intercourse with literally everything he encountered, animal or mineral, including “a papaya, which proved more satisfying than a melon”. I am sold on the larger part of Sanghera’s thesis, that the empire could be rotten and we don’t know enough about it. I’m not sold on the claim that no doubt attracts O’Brien, that . Brexit, Remainers often say, was informed by a myth of British exceptionalism, that because we once ran large parts of the world, we thought we didn’t need Europe and could go it alone. To prove this, the author quotes a lot of Boris Johnson, an admirer of Churchill who recites Kipling, but the PM is the product of a very unusual public school education – and Brexit was made possible by the support of the working-class, many of whom have never travelled further afield than the Costa del Sol. We are invited to swallow the paradox that the general public are simultaneously ignorant of empire and obsessed with it. If we are uneducated – and a lot of what Sanghera documents is news to me – then I’d add that there’s a lot that defines us that we don’t know about, such as the Vikings, the civil war or the Wycliffe Bible. Historical amnesia is not limited to the long 19th century. But the Left focuses on that period, with some justification, because modern Britain emerged from the twin experiences of industry and colonisation, hence empire speaks to our contemporary concerns around class and race. We are, as Sanghera notes, a multicultural country thanks to empire, yet the empire was also “a wilful, unapologetic exercise in white racial supremacy” that dehumanised black people “on a super-industrial scale”. Whites were persuaded that they were top of the food chain and had a God-given right to be in charge – yet also, when the colonised began to migrate here, vulnerable to invasion. Travel beyond the playing fields of Eton, however, and you’ll find that many people voted for Brexit not to run the world but step back from it, to work on unfinished business back home. Granted, a lot of far-Right boobs backed Brexit, but so did plenty of moderates, some socialists and a roughly a quarter of non-white voters. If they wanted to turn the clock back to any particular moment, it was probably the 1950s, to an imagined time of safe streets and strong communities – to welfare state Britain, not the buccaneering British Empire. A far greater shadow is cast over the present by the Second World War, which is popularly remembered not as a defence of empire (which it was) but as a fight for democracy against fascism – against imperialism, if you will. Sanghera’s point, I guess, is that we are unconscious citizens of Empireland: empire made us, whether we realise it or not. He might be correct, but no one likes being told “I know you better than you know yourself”, and I suspect that the reason why many take offence at the attempt to “decolonise” high streets or the school curriculum is not because they are protective of empire but because they see it as an attempt to politicise their culture and daily life. They also suspect that history is being invoked to compel us to think or behave a certain way, that because Britain is guilty of crimes in the past, we must shuffle into the future with an embarrassed air, perpetually voting for whatever liberals want, to prove that we aren’t as bad as our ancestors were. The history is on Sanghera’s side. The facts speak for themselves. But just as the history of empire cannot be reduced, like Sanghera insists, to simple binaries of good vs evil, nor can the dynamics of historical memory. "
politics,,,,,"Women are the majority of the population, so our votes count. Obviously we are not a homogenous group. Yet increasingly I hear women voice their political homelessness. Many such women are Left-leaning and have previously voted Labour, Lib Dem or Green, but now they feel unwanted. They feel alienated – dumped by the political parties they once supported, for their refusal to discuss women’s rights under the guise that these discussions are now ‘transphobic’. The Stonewall tactic of ‘no debate’ has been highly successful. We saw it recently when Sadiq Kahn was asked by a member of the London Assembly about the definition of women he’d once put in a tweet: “You’ve said trans women are women – so do you think some women have male reproductive organs?”. Six other members of the Assembly jumped in to shut down debate and supported a subsequent motion to prevent him from having such a discussion with the mayor. His  speech was deemed discriminatory. Whether this member of the Assembly was genuinely interested in women’s rights, or just wanted to pick a fight with Khan isn’t the issue. For me, it is that respectable politicians aren’t willing to define what a woman is. And they are certainly not shy about putting definitions to other people and causes. In the latest report by the Labour Party, “ ” the aim is laudable: to increase representation of trans people in the party and make sure they can take part in all activities safely and “without fear”. It’s a shame no such consultation was ever held about protecting its female Jewish MPs, but there you go. Much of the defining of transphobia is as you would expect until you get to this: “claiming there is a ‘conflict’ between trans people’s rights and women’s or other communities is transphobic.” Herein madness lies. To ask a question or have a disagreement about single sex spaces is transphobic? The word not only becomes meaningless, it loses all contact with the real world. Ask most of us if we support trans rights and we’ll say yes, but when asked if those who have not transitioned in any meaningful way can enter single sex spaces, then the majority are unhappy or just have some questions about it. To not even have this discussion is now considered a win for lobby groups, but it is a loss to many politically active women. Lifelong activists have been threatened with expulsion from the Labour Party and told they must be “re-educated”. These are women who have set up refuges and run trade unions. Is all this a vote-winning exercise? I have heard of canvassers shouting TERF (Trans exclusionary radical feminists) at women on the doorstep when they simply asked about women’s rights. Way to go! The Lib Dems are also fully subscribed to this groovy gender ideology. The likes of Layla Moran spout stuff about not caring about bodies, but seeing into people’s souls. This is the equivalent of those well-meaning liberals who “don’t see colour” and  is frankly, insulting. Many Lib Dem women are unhappy, and the news that one of  their big donors is a company that makes puberty blockers (Ferring Pharmaceuticals ) is more than uncomfortable. The Greens, who don’t like GM crops, suddenly seem to be embracing the case for puberty-blocking hormones and are so fully gender fluid that women exist simply now as “non-men”. The Greens have also embraced Aimee Knight, née Challenor, who is trans, as a Green Candidate for Coventry City Council. When she stood in the 2018 deputy leadership contest, her agent was her father, David who was sentenced to prison for 22 years for the rape and torture of a 10-year-old-girl in the family home. Aimee then joined the Lib Dems but was suspended in 2019 after tweets appeared on her partner’s account about fantasising about sex with children. She has since said the account appeared to have been hacked and the comments were not posted by her fiancé. The key point is, that in order to embrace fashionable diversity, key checks seem to have been overlooked. In Scotland, women have been thrown under every available bus. The women who accused Salmond of inappropriate behaviour at the recent inquiry are now simply irrelevant. Its new Hate Crime Bill does little to actually make the lives of trans people better, but is an attempt to appear more progressive than England .  Bit by bit, women’s sex-based rights are being eroded. Parties formed to protect the environment or to achieve independence have fallen over themselves to get in with the trans rights movement . So there is now a huge number of floating voters who are not anti-trans, but simply want to keep our sex- based rights and protections. Many of us are not Tories. So which savvy political party might speak for us or even recognise that we exist? We are met only with fear, abuse and silence. Do our votes not matter?"

Red Wall by-election fight for Keir Starmer after MP resigns following harassment allegations
","
Mike Hill has stood down as an MP for Hartlepool with immediate effect
","Danielle Sheridan, ","
16 March 2021 • 1:51pm
","Sir Keir Starmer is set to face the first test of his leadership at the polls in May, after a Red Wall MP stood down on Tuesday following sexual harassment allegations. Mike Hill, the Labour MP for Hartlepool, resigned his seat weeks before an employment tribunal is to hear sexual harassment and victimisation allegations against him. His departure will trigger a by-election in one of the Labour Party’s most vulnerable seats, which Mr Hill retained with a significantly reduced vote share at the 2019 election after the chairman of the Brexit Party stood against him. The by-election could see Paul Williams, another Labour Red Wall MP who lost his seat in 2019, take on the Conservatives and Richard Tice, now chairman of the rebranded Brexit Party, Reform UK. Mr Hill was suspended from the Labour Party in September 2019 over sexual assault allegations, but readmitted after his accuser’s complaint to the party was “parked”, pending the outcome of an investigation by Parliament’s Independent Complaints and Grievance Process. An employment tribunal for sexual harassment and victimisation will begin at the London Central Employment Tribunal on May 10. Mr Hill strongly denies the allegations. It is understood that he met with Nick Brown, Labour’s chief whip, on Tuesday morning and made the decision to resign. The by-election in Hartlepool is expected to take place alongside the local elections on May 6.  The Telegraph understands the leadership of Hartlepool’s local Labour association is planning to install Mr Williams as their candidate for the by-election on a single-candidate shortlist. Mr Williams is currently the Labour candidate for Police and Crime Commissioner (PCC) in Cleveland, but plans to stand instead for the Hartlepool seat in an attempt to return to Parliament. He was previously the MP for Stockton South. The secretary of the Hartlepool Constituency Labour Party, Anth Frain, has written to other members to express concern that choosing Mr Williams, a moderate candidate, without a full selection process will be seized upon by hard-Left Labour members as a fait accompli by allies of Sir Keir. Mr Frain has privately warned senior figures in the CLP that hard-Left members will have to be reassured Mr Williams was the choice of local members rather than Sir Keir’s office. Labour’s vote share in Hartlepool dropped by almost 15 per cent at the 2019 election, following a surge in support for the Brexit Party candidate, Mr Tice. Mr Tice now leads Reform UK, the Brexit Party's successor, and told The Telegraph he was ""actively considering"" standing again. ""We've obviously got some big decisions to make and a lot depends on when the by-election is,"" he said. ""I'm the only one that stands for cutting taxes for the least well off and the lowest paid amongst any of the parties. I think actually there's a very clear agenda that works for the people of Hartlepool."" Mr Tice said if he did decide to stand, the Conservative Party should withdraw their candidate to increase his chance of beating Labour. ""The Tories should say: 'No, Richard, you stand, and let's damage Keir Starmer',"" he said. ""That puts Labour in a right pickle."" A Tory source responded: ""[Tice] doesn’t care about the people of Hartlepool. All he cares about is climbing the political career ladder.” The Conservatives finished second at the last election, but have opened up as the odds-on favourites at 1-2 to win the by-election. Labour are 13-8 to retain the seat, according to the bookmaker Coral. A Labour Party spokesman said: “Mike Hill has resigned as Member of Parliament for Hartlepool with immediate effect.”"

Raise school starting age to seven, Scottish Lib Dems argue

The party wants to introduce a 'truly play-based education' until age seven

","Children in Scotland should start school at the age of seven rather than four or five, the Scottish Liberal Democrats have insisted in a “radical” new proposal. As the first full week of campaigning for the Holyrood elections began, party leader Willie Rennie said delaying the age children start school will help give youngsters a “flying start”. It comes as Nicola Sturgeon promised to   if the SNP is re-elected in May, despite failing to meet her previous pledge of closing the education attainment gap between rich and poor pupils.  Focusing on their plans for education, the Lib Dems hailed the plan as a ""historical, radical and positive change"" in Scotland's school system. They want youngsters to have a ""truly play-based education"" up to the age of seven - when more formal schooling would begin. The expanded early years education would be mandatory, they stressed, and would focus on areas such as child development, social skills and outdoor learning, as well as physical and mental health. Mr Rennie said: ""Scottish Liberal Democrats will introduce a truly play-based education until age seven, to give every child a flying start. ""By learning together through play, children develop the skills needed for trickier tasks and are better prepared to shine in areas like literacy and numeracy."" He continued: ""The UK is almost unique in Europe in expecting children as young as four or five to begin formal schooling. By the age of nine, pupils in Finland have much higher reading levels than pupils in the UK, having started at the age of seven."" Mr Rennie pledged his party would also ""immediately abolish the national testing of four- and five-year-olds introduced by the SNP and heavily criticised by teachers"". Speaking about the standardised assessments, he said that parliament voted to halt them “years ago” but was “ignored”. ""The SNP claimed the support of world-leading experts for the controversial policy, only for those same experts to call it a 'perverse misrepresentation' of their work and conclude the tests were 'completely useless'."" Responding to the pledge, an SNP spokesperson said: ""We recognise that there is a debate to be had and agree 5 and 6 year olds should have 'play-based' education.  ""That’s what primaries do now and, given there is no consensus on increasing age, we do not currently support changing."""

Labour torn over Bristol protests as shadow home secretary backs police

Nick Thomas-Symonds warned the clashes were undermining “legitimate” opposition to Government legislation on new police powers
","Harry Yorke, ","
28 March 2021 • 8:10pm
","The shadow home secretary has sided with the police over the Bristol protests after a hard left MP claimed that “police brutality is the boot of the capitalist state”.  In a sign of deepening divisions within Labour over further clashes over the weekend, Nick Thomas-Symonds said that the “violence being perpetrated” by a minority in Bristol was “unacceptable”. Mr Thomas-Symonds added that the events were undermining “legitimate” opposition to Government legislation which would hand the police more powers to tackle non-violent protests, including those deemed too noisy or a nuisance.  The demonstrations are being organised under the slogan “Kill the Bill.” He was speaking after bricks, glass and fireworks were thrown at officers during demonstrations in the city centre, where protesters have held multiple protests in recent days.  While the Prime Minister and Home Secretary have condemned the “disgraceful” scenes, activists and some MPs have hit out at reports of protesters and at least one journalist being tackled physically.  They included Nadia Whittome, a Labour MP who quit Sir Keir’s frontbench last year, who said on Saturday: “The case for an independent investigation into the policing of the Bristol protests is clear.” Her comments were echoed by Zarah Sultana, the Labour MP for Coventry South, who wrote on Twitter: “The first lesson is to end the establishment presumption that protesters are always guilty and must be to blame. History tells us that’s false.” Going further, Claudia Webbe MP, who is currently suspended from the Labour Party, said: “Police brutality is the boot of a capitalist state established to keep us all in order.” She added: “This is not policing by consent and falls well short of acceptable standards; police are acting with impunity, this must be condemned. Silence is not an option.” Mr Thomas-Symonds appeared to distance himself from the remarks yesterday, telling Times Radio that he did not agree with either Ms Webbe or Ms Whittome.  “People should obviously have a way of making their voice heard of course and there are ways to do that in a covid-secure and safe way and that's absolutely what they should be doing,” he added. “But let me be clear that the scenes of violence that we've seen in Bristol, from a minority of protesters are totally and utterly unacceptable.  “That shouldn't be happening and they're not helping the cause, the legitimate cause of arguing against the protest provisions in the policing bill.”"

In an interview with The Telegraph, she said: “Those increases are from literally across all parts of the country and all regions so from North, South, East, West, we've seen an increase, which is fantastic news.” The biggest spikes have been in the North East, where membership has risen by 100 per cent since March 2018, a rise matched by the party in Wales.

The make-up of the membership base has changed markedly over the past 15 years, Ms Milling indicated. “We only have to look at the parliamentary party to see how different the party is,” she said. “In terms of the diversity, look at the number of women we’ve got now, look at the number of BAME MPs we’ve got, but also the backgrounds of people.”  The proportion of Tory MPs who are female or from black, Asian and minority ethnic backgrounds has risen at recent elections. The Conservative party membership is still dwarfed by Labour, which boasts around  495,000 members. The opposition party has seen a recent downward trend, however, with membership declining by 57,000 since  Ms Milling said the Tory party had adapted well to using online platforms during the past year of the pandemic. “Associations across the country are now doing their AGMs [annual general meetings] online, [candidate] selections online.” Virtual fundraisers and quizzes have also been hosted. Some online local meetings have been so popular that party members from other parts of the country have “Zoom bombed” them."

Biden tells Johnson they should build massive global infrastructure plan to rival China
","
US president said democratic countries should have a project to rival Beijing's flagship Belt and Road initiative

","Joe Biden said he suggested to Boris Johnson in a phone call on Friday that they should have a massive infrastructure plan to rival China's Belt and Road initiative. The US president, in his second call with the British Prime Minister since taking office, said he was concerned that Beijing's project would significantly expand its economic and political influence. ""I suggested we should have, essentially, a similar initiative, pulling from the democratic states, helping those communities around the world that, in fact, need help,"" Mr Biden told reporters. China’s Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) is a multi-trillion-dollar infrastructure scheme launched in 2013 by President Xi Jinping involving development and investment initiatives that would stretch from East Asia to Europe. Mr Biden said in his first full press briefing with reports on Thursday that the world was going through a “fourth industrial revolution” and that Beijing was looking to assert global dominance. ""I see stiff competition with China,” the president said. “They have an overall goal to become the leading country in the world, the wealthiest country in the world, and the most powerful country in the world. That's not going to happen on my watch.” Mr Biden plans to unveil a multi-trillion-dollar plan to upgrade US infrastructure next week. He said on Thursday this would ensure increased US investment in promising new technologies, such as quantum computing, artificial intelligence and biotechnology. The comment made by Mr Biden did not appear on the UK Government’s readout of the call, but when asked about it later he said: “We talked a lot about the need also for Britain and the United States to, to stand together and deal with the whole notion of whether or not NATO stands together, whether we stand united, and whether or not I'd be able to come, and I hope I can, to NATO meeting - I think it's in late June.”   He went on: ""One of the things I suggested we do is - we talked about China and the competition they're engaging in in the Belt and Road Initiative. And I suggested we should have, essentially, a similar initiative coming from the democratic states, helping those communities around the world."" His predecessor Donald Trump spent his term trying to undermine China’s Belt and Road Initiative. However, in the last few years more than a dozen Latin American countries and 10 Caribbean nations have joined.  Meanwhile, nearly all Nato member states in Eastern and Southern Europe have associations with the project. According to a Refinitiv database, as of mid-last year, over 2,600 projects at a cost of $3.7 trillion were linked to the initiative."

Labour rejects Tory tactical voting plan to thwart Alex Salmond's independence 'super-majority'
","
Anas Sarwar dismissed as a ""game"" a Tory proposal that the best-placed pro-UK candidate in each seat be given a clear run to defeat the SNP.

","Labour's new Scottish leader has refused to sign up to any pact with the other Unionist parties to thwart Alex Salmond's aim of delivering a ""super-majority"" for independence in the Scottish Parliament election. Anas Sarwar dismissed as a ""game"" a Tory proposal that the best-placed pro-UK candidate in each constituency be given  , with the other Unionist parties standing down their candidates. Mr Sarwar attacked Douglas Ross, the Scottish Tory leader, for ""playing games at a time of national emergency"" and said  is ""not a serious attempt to reframe our political debate around the constitution"".  Referring to the furious war between Mr Salmond and Nicola Sturgeon, he claimed Alba was instead ""an attempt to settle scores, to seek revenge and about individual people's egos."" But the Scottish Tories accused him of underestimating the threat posed to the Union by Mr Salmond's new party and said it was ""hugely disappointing"" to see him reject the plan. Psephologists have warned that the Alba Party could pick up a seat in each of the eight regions in the Holyrood election if it secures only 6.6 per cent of the list vote, with five of the seats being lost by the Unionist parties. Mr Salmond plans to exploit the Scottish Parliament's complicated voting system to deliver more than 90 pro-independence MSPs in 129-member chamber. The SNP won 59 out of 73 constituencies in the 2016 election but only four on the regional list, which assigns seats to parties using a complicated form of proportional representation that deducts constituency wins. Under Mr Salmond's plan to 'game' the system, pro-independence Scots would vote SNP with their constituency vote and Alba Party on their regional ballot paper. Mr Ross insisted at the weekend that it was time for him, Mr Sarwar and Willie Rennie, the Scottish Lib Dem leader, to   to stop Mr Salmond's plan. He said Mr Sarwar and Mr Rennie were ""not recognising the clear and present danger from the Alba Party"", but the Scottish Labour leader rejected the accusation. Mr Sarwar said: ""I think what you see from Douglas Ross, and actually from Alex Salmond, is politics as a game. This is not a game, this election is not a game, our parliament is not a game. ""It is about focusing on what our priorities should be as a country, and deciding what the focus of our parliament should be for the next five years."" He said he had urged Mr Ross to ""grow up"" and argued that ""what he is trying to do is to play a game because he has no ideas about how we unite our country around a recovery plan."" Arguing that the contest was ""in many ways a wartime election"" thanks to the pandemic, he argued the public would not expect politicians to focus on ""the old arguments or trying to settle scores."" Asked if Mr Salmond should take part in future TV debates, Mr Sarwar added: ""I want no part of that kind of ego-trip of one individual, because our recovery is more important than the psychodrama of Alex Salmond and Nicola Sturgeon."" But Annie Wells, a Scottish Tory candidate, said: ""Anas Sarwar and Scottish Labour just don’t seem to get how real the threat of another independence referendum is. “It is hugely disappointing to see him once again reject our calls to join together and stand up to the threats from the nationalists."""
politics,,,,,"The Government’s Commission on Race and Ethnic Disparities, set up in the wake of the Black Lives Matter protests last year, will release its report later this week, but already the indications are that it intends to challenge the Left-wing consensus on race in the UK. One of its recommendations is said to be that the term BAME – Black and Minority Ethnic – should no longer be used. If that can be enforced, not only would we be rid of a term that is confusing and alienating, but one that is entirely unhelpful and counterproductive. On the most basic level, the idea that all non-white people can be lumped together as if they are one homogenous group is absurd and offensive. Just consider the statistics, released yesterday, on take-up for the Covid vaccines. For all the talk of “BAME” vaccine hesitancy, people from Indian backgrounds are almost as likely as white British people to have been inoculated. The lowest take-up is among those from black African backgrounds, but you wouldn’t know that if you examined the issue solely through the prism of “BAME”. Even looking at the  , there are enormous discrepancies. I used to be an assistant principal of a school, and one of big questions in education is why children from black African families tend to do better than those from black Carribean families. How does it help to answer that question by lumping them together as “black pupils”, let alone BAME pupils? The term is inherently divisive, pitting white people against those from ethnic minority backgrounds. It implicitly supports the ideology of critical race theory – and the dangerous idea that some people are naturally at a disadvantage because of their skin colour, while others have “privilege” because of theirs. Not only is that a lazy way of analysing the different outcomes of different groups, it’s wrong, presenting a false narrative of race relations in the UK. Many ethnic minority people dislike having their specific backgrounds erased by the  . And what of those of us who are mixed race? Proponents of BAME presumably think they are being helpful, but there is a growing population of people in the UK – those who are neither exclusively ethnic minority nor exclusively white, but somewhere in between – who do not fit neatly into their patronising top-down terminology. If ethnicity is linked with identity, labelling a mixed-race person BAME is essentially to force us to disregard half of our heritage, half of our culture, and half of our ethnicity. Ultimately, we need to move away from the idea of ethnicity being core to our identities. Grouping people by their immutable characteristics is a tool the hard-Left use to control us. We do not choose our immutable characteristics, so why must they define us? Our personality traits are not set in stone by accident of birth – we choose how we want to live our lives and the types of people we want to be, and we mustn’t let anyone tell us otherwise. It would be naive to suggest that we don’t have issues with racism or discrimination to resolve here in the UK. But on the whole, race relations in this country are fantastic. We should avoid dodgy terminologies that divide us unnecessarily and stop us from fixing the problems we do have."
politics,,,,,"History offers no close parallel with the modern rise of China. The sudden emergence of a nation comprising a full fifth of humanity as a new great power is a unique event. Yet as Western capitals take stock of sanctions imposed by Beijing on parliamentarians, diplomats and academics, including British MPs, we can find some historical analogies with the current development of Chinese foreign policy. In particular, we can hear an echo of late 19th-century Germany. By the 1870s, Germany was the rising nation of the age, building an industrial, diplomatic and military power at great speed. With the artful Bismarck at the helm, it confronted and defeated one rival after another – starting small with Denmark, then dealing with Austria before humbling mighty France – being careful to isolate each one in turn and never to provoke unity among rivals. By the turn of the 20th century, its continental dominance and global role seemed assured. But under  , an increasingly aggressive foreign policy became counter-productive, driving Britain, France and Russia to ally against Germany. There are many differences. China has neither needed nor wanted to pursue its goals by military conquest and has prided itself on a “peaceful rise”. Its diplomatic strategy, however, has been until recently a model of “divide and rule” that Bismarck would have recognised and admired. Any European nations that offended China, in particular by meeting the Dalai Lama at senior level, were punished with a freeze in political relations and threats of economic consequences. Norway, which hosted the award of the Nobel Peace Prize for the incarcerated human rights activist Liu Xiaobo, was picked out for six years of denunciation. On each occasion, the rest of Europe got on with pursuing commercial ties with China and avoided confrontation. The collective behaviour of Western nations was akin to a herd of antelope when one has been savaged by a lion, keeping clear of the immediate area but rapidly getting back to grazing. When Beijing froze political contacts with the UK for 18 months when I was foreign secretary, I don’t recall any reaction from other foreign ministers except relief it was not them. China has no doubt drawn the lesson from this period that democracies lack solidarity. We have seemed so focused on commercial priorities and fear of missing out in the global gold rush to the east that we care little about our neighbours being singled out. If dictators have in their mind a stereotype of capitalist democracies pursuing profits at all costs, we unfortunately conformed to it. Emboldened by growing strength and accustomed to Western division, China under Xi Jinping has doubled down on confronting criticism with an emphatic response, even if that means being rude and aggressive in tone. The last Chinese ambassador to Sweden embodied an approach of being quicker to take offence and sharper in retaliation, informing that peaceful country that “we treat our friends with fine wine but for our enemies we have shotguns”. Australia has been particularly singled out for commercial as well as verbal bullying, with many exports to China suspended. China’s response last week to the   was true to the “wolf warrior” playbook of diplomacy. Scorning any notion of a proportionate “tit for tat”, China decided to place individual sanctions on dozens of people who have criticised the treatment of the Uyghurs. Somewhat stunned by this, MEPs in Brussels have now turned against ratifying the investment treaty the EU signed with China in January. In this country, universities have become alarmed at the threat of Chinese behaviour to academic freedom. In a democratic society such as our own, the placing of sanctions on MPs, including Sir Iain Duncan Smith and Tom Tugendhat, encourages all of us to defend their right to free speech. Even for those of us who emphasise the need to find ways of working with China on many global issues, the attempt to suppress criticism will give an incentive to step it up. The emerging evidence of what seems to be an effort to eradicate Uyghur culture in Xinjiang deserves global condemnation. Vast numbers of people are interned in hundreds of “re-education” camps’; there are clear reports of mass sterilisation of Uyghur women; the whole area is under minute and intrusive surveillance and half a million people are forced to pick cotton. Arguments about whether this amounts to genocide are semantic: it most certainly is the violation of basic human rights on an industrial scale. Ten years ago, the result of China imposing penalties of any kind in return for Western criticism would have been that others kept quiet. Now, however, the result will be that others speak up. Like Germany by the 1890s, the country is taken much more seriously, and its behaviour in foreign affairs has become more obviously unattractive. Public surveys show distrust of China intensifying. A recent YouGov survey across 24 countries showed more people preferred the US as a world power in all but one of them. In 1895, Lord Salisbury remarked to the German ambassador on the “rudeness of German communications, much increased since Bismarck’s time” and complained that “the conduct of the German emperor is very mysterious and difficult to explain”. Ultimately, such conduct led Britain to end “splendid isolationism” and join alliances against Germany. By that stage, it would be surprising if the ambassador had the confidence to tell the Kaiser that his approach might be mistaken, and was unnecessarily adding to his enemies. Today it would be appropriate to explain to a Chinese ambassador that an over-reaction to inevitable criticism will jeopardise Beijing’s objectives more than might be realised. The EU and US are driven together just when they were moving apart. MPs who are picked on will win stronger support. The huge and expensive effort to expand Chinese “soft power” will be wasted money. But would that ambassador feel able to recommend to his superiors a more productive approach? Almost certainly not. Chinese leaders are fond of quoting from the mistakes of history. But now they are starting to repeat them."

Boris Johnson urged to consider lifting 'work from home' guidance next month
","
Tory MPs urge Prime Minister to 'get us back to the office as soon as is safe and feasible'
","Ben Riley-Smith, ","

","Conservative MPs are calling on Boris Johnson to consider lifting   from next month to help quicken an economic rebound  . They argue that with more than half the adult population having  , those who want to return to the office should be allowed to do so. While a detailed Government   has been published, clarity on when people will no longer be advised to work at home if possible is yet to emerge. It is being looked at as part of review of  , with changes expected to come in at June 17 at the earliest. Steve Baker, the deputy chairman of the Covid Recovery Group of lockdown-sceptic Tory MPs, told The Telegraph: ""If we don't end working from home then the businesses dependent on offices full of people will be in existential difficulty. That's why Boris Johnson should follow the data and get us back to the office as soon as is safe and feasible. ""With the vulnerable vaccinated and the link between hospitalisations and deaths now broken, I would have thought the Prime Minister should be exploring April 12 for a return to offices."" Another senior Tory backbencher said: ""My general view is that if the data stays good and improves then things should be accelerated. I don't take the view that people should be forced to go back to the office. I'd expect we'll have a much more hybrid arrangement. I think that people should be free to go back to the office."" Both Mr Johnson and Rishi Sunak, the Chancellor, have recently indicated that they expect many people who have been working from home  . Working from home fatigue appears to be setting in, with a 20 percentage point rise in the number of people planning on returning to the office. A study by the Royal Institute of Chartered Surveyors (RICS) found that workers could return to offices faster than expected as a result of the success of the vaccine rollout. It found that in the three months to February 80 per cent of employees now wanted to head back once the pandemic is over, up from fewer than 60 per cent in the previous quarter. An RCS report said this change in perceptions may be attributed to ""the speed of  , with more people now seemingly expecting a faster return to normal life than previously anticipated"". Kath Fontana, the RICS president and a facilities management specialist, said: ""We've all recognised that workplaces will need to adapt as a result of Covid-19, but it's very revealing that this latest survey shows much more optimism on the return to the office. ""What we've seen is employers using this time to look forward to and plan ahead for what the 'new normal' will look like. Effective facilities management will be even more crucial as we build back from this pandemic – the positive sentiment expressed by our professionals on the ground in this survey is light at the end of this dark tunnel."""

Why Ursula von der Leyen won't quit over AstraZeneca vaccine row
","
Ursula von der Leyen refused to take personal responsibility for the vaccine fiasco and urged Europeans to judge her in three years time
","James Crisp, ","
2 February 2021 • 12:56pm
","Ursula von der Leyen has no plans to quit after last week’s coronavirus vaccine fiasco, despite suffering the worst week of her career as president of the European Commission.  Today she  for the vaccine fiasco and instead urged Europeans to judge her in three years time at the end of her term in office.  She is facing unprecedented criticism across the EU after her gaffe-strewn handling of the row with AstraZeneca.  Brussels’ threat to  , and the slow roll-out of vaccinations across the bloc have increased the pressure on the former German defence minister.  As far as Mrs von der Leyen, who has   commissioner and is accused of centralising all power in her small circle of trusted advisors, is concerned she is going nowhere.  In truth, there is little political appetite in the European Parliament, which can remove a commission president, or in EU capitals for Mrs von der Leyen to go.  The European Commission is playing an important role in the procurement of vaccines and the coordination of coronavirus measures among the member states.  Defenestrating its president now, with the pandemic raging and a massive economic stimulus package to be rolled out, is still seen as self-defeating.  It would trigger a long process to replace her and, possibly the whole college of commissioner, which would cost valuable time.  There is no ready made replacement waiting in the wings and, even if they had the power to force her out, member states were responsible for appointing her in the first place and won’t want to publicise their error. A fragmented European Parliament approved Mrs von der Leyen with a majority of just nine votes and the fiasco has cost her some support, which could impact her ability to get EU law passed.  It is true that those EU governments less enamoured of Brussels overreach would welcome having a lame duck commission president in place.  Both EU governments and the European Parliament will also be keen to avoid a clash over the method used to choose the president.  EU leaders, led by Emmanuel Macron and Angela Merkel, ditched the Spitzenkandidat system, which tied the results of the European elections to the top job. Much to the fury of the European Parliament, they returned to the summit stitch-ups that had chosen all commission presidents except Jean-Claude Juncker.  Promises were made to return to the failed experiment in democracy in the future, which even the frequently supine MEPs would insist upon if Mrs von der Leyen was to go.  Any British politician who faced  would be expected to at least consider their position or quit, as Theresa May did.  Resignations in response to failure have sadly fallen out of fashion in Westminster but have rarely been à la mode in Brussels, the de facto capital of the European Union.  The sole president of the European Commission to fall on his sword was Jacques Santer, who resigned in 1999 before he was removed by MEPs amid a corruption scandal  Jean-Claude Juncker stayed resolutely in post when the beginning of his presidency was engulfed by the Luxleaks scandal, which exposed his role in Luxembourg’s sweetheart tax deals with multinationals.  To British observers it may appear incredible that Mrs von der Leyen will survive her botched handling of the pandemic.  But while Europe’s capitals, grateful for a scapegoat for their own national failings in the pandemic, are more than happy to drag her over the coals, there is no political appetite to replace her. ""In this crisis the commission saw a chance for itself to act as a government but governments sometimes step down when things go wrong or at least are held accountable by their parliaments,"" one EU diplomat said.  ""Having said that, member states have allowed them to do this because they are too busy managing their own crisis."""
politics,,,,,"Compared with the colossal sums spent by the Government during the pandemic as a whole, of course, it’s a drop in the ocean. Even so, as   hosted this latest Downing Street news conference, it was hard to help wondering: how on earth did they manage to blow £2.6million on that new media room? And how could something so expensive look so cheap? This was the first time the room had been put to use, and the immediate effect was disorienting. The new room had none of the sophistication, elegance or sense of history the old room had. In fact, you might not have guessed it was in Downing Street at all. Especially because of the awkward visual clash between the glowing electric blue of the backdrop, the chocolate-brown wood of the lecterns, and the enormous Union flags standing either side of the Prime Minister. It was as if a courtroom had been repurposed as the set of an extremely patriotic ITV game show, or the Glasgow Rangers club shop. “Good afternoon, and welcome,” began Mr Johnson. But it was no use. I was still transfixed by his strange new surroundings. What had been wrong with the old room? All right, so perhaps the floral carpet had been a little unsightly. One reader wrote to tell me it reminded her of a bedspread her grandmother crocheted and gave her as a wedding present. (“It retains a sickly smell of mothballs and Yardley’s Lavender.”) But the rest of the old room, at least, had exuded a stately, aged grandeur. Not like this new eyesore. Once again, that cost to the tax-payer: £2.6million. In the digital age, you’d think that instead of going to the expense of constructing a new room, they could just have stood the PM in front of a green screen and given him a computer-generated backdrop. In fact, give him a different backdrop each time, to reflect the tone of whatever he was announcing that particular day. If he was announcing the end of lockdown: footage of a jubilant street carnival. If he was making a statement about the economy: footage of a barren, icy wasteland. And so on. As it turned out, on this occasion the Prime Minister had little of particular note to announce – although he did confirm that   of England.  For whatever reason, Mr Johnson did not specify where in the northeast, but the answer is none other than the delightful market town of  . Let’s just hope the delivery men steer clear of any shortsighted motorists. “See you next time!” blared Mr Johnson, game show-style, and toddled off. Cut back to the BBC News studio, where the presenter cheerfully described the new media room as “rather splendid”. A somewhat surprising verdict. Perhaps it was the presence of those enormous  . The BBC was always bound to love those."
politics,,,,,"The Covid-19 pandemic is the biggest challenge to the global community since the 1940s.  At that time, following the devastation of two world wars, political leaders came together to forge the multilateral system. The aims were clear – to bring countries together, to dispel the temptations of isolationism and nationalism and to address the challenges that could only be achieved together in the spirit of solidarity and co-operation, namely peace, prosperity, health and security. Today we hold the same hope that, as we fight to overcome the Covid-19 pandemic together, we can build a more robust international health architecture that will protect future generations.  There   and other major health emergencies. No single government or multilateral agency can address this threat alone. The question is not if, but when. Together, we must be better prepared to predict, prevent, detect, assess and effectively respond to pandemics in a highly co-ordinated fashion. The Covid-19 pandemic has been a stark and painful reminder that  . We are, therefore, committed to ensuring universal and equitable access to safe, efficacious and affordable vaccines, medicines and diagnostics for this  .  Immunisation is a global public good and we will need to be able to develop, manufacture and deploy vaccines as quickly as possible. This is why the   (ACT-A) was set up in order to promote equal access to tests, treatments and vaccines and support health systems across the globe. ACT-A has delivered on many aspects, but equitable access is not achieved yet. There is more we can do to promote global access. To that end, we believe that nations should work together towards   for pandemic preparedness and response. Such a renewed collective commitment would be a milestone in stepping up pandemic preparedness at the highest political level. It would be rooted in the constitution of the World Health Organisation, drawing in other relevant organisations key to this endeavour, in support of the principle of health for all.   Existing global health instruments, especially the International Health Regulations, would  , ensuring a firm and tested foundation on which we can build and improve. The main goal of this treaty would be to foster an all of government and all of society approach, strengthening national, regional and global capacities and resilience to future pandemics. This includes greatly enhancing international co-operation to improve, for example, alert systems, data-sharing, research and local, regional and global production and distribution of medical and public health counter-measures such as vaccines, medicines, diagnostics and personal protective equipment. It would also include recognition of a ""One Health"" approach that connects the health of humans, animals and our planet. And such a treaty should lead to more mutual accountability and shared responsibility, transparency and co-operation within the international system and with its rules and norms. To achieve this, we will work with heads of state and governments globally, and all stakeholders including civil society and the private sector. We are convinced that it is our responsibility, as leaders of nations and international institutions, to ensure that the world learns the lessons of the Covid-19 pandemic. At a time when Covid-19 has exploited our weaknesses and divisions, we must seize this opportunity and come together as a global community for peaceful co-operation that extends beyond this crisis. Building our capacities and systems to do this will take time and require a sustained political, financial and societal commitment over many years. Our solidarity in ensuring that the world is better prepared will be our legacy that protects our children and grandchildren and minimises the impact of future pandemics on our economies and our societies.  Pandemic preparedness needs global leadership for a global health system fit for this millennium. To make this commitment a reality, we must be guided by solidarity, fairness, transparency, inclusiveness and equity."

Ursula von der Leyen snubbed world leaders' plea for pandemic response

European Commission president's absence from list of signatories raises fears she plans to pursue a hardline stance on Covid vaccine exports
","James Crisp, ","
30 March 2021 • 1:16pm
","Divisions over the EU’s vaccination crisis have been laid bare after Ursula von der Leyen refused to sign up   for a new global pandemics plan. The European Commission president’s name was notably absent  . The list included EU leaders such as Angela Merkel, Emmanuel Macron, and Charles Michel, the European Council president, as well as Boris Johnson. Other leaders of EU countries, including Mario Draghi of Italy, Pedro Sanchez of Spain, Mark Rutte of the Netherlands, as well as the leaders of Greece, Romania and Portugal, put their names to the call to prevent “isolationism and nationalism” when facing pandemics. “Indeed the Commission was informed of the op-ed and the scope of the Treaty on Pandemics but chose not to co-sign,” an EU official said. Mrs von der Leyen’s snub to the call for “universal and equitable access to safe, efficacious and affordable vaccines,” and a global settlement similar to that forged after the Second World War will raise fears she intends to pursue a hardline stance on vaccine export bans. The Telegraph understands that Mrs von der Leyen was given more than one opportunity to back the pandemic plan. Sources in Brussels said that the joint statement would have been a very positive sign for resolving   - had Mrs von der Leyen signed. Negotiations between the UK and Brussels continue this week. The commission is locked in a bitter dispute with AstraZeneca after the company announced shortfalls in supplies to the bloc. AstraZeneca has committed to deliveries of just 70m doses instead of the promised 180m for the second quarter, which follows delays in the first quarter. The UK is the main target for these bans because of the ongoing dispute with Brussels over supplies from the two British AstraZeneca factories and the company’s Halix plant in the Netherlands. The commission has threatened to block exports from Halix to the UK, unless the UK drops its first refusal on supplies from ther UK factories to the bloc. The commission did not confirm or deny that Mrs von der Leyen was given the chance to sign up to the opinion piece. EU sources suggested Mrs von der Leyen may have refused to sign because she felt the international treaty would overshadow her plans for a Global Health Summit in Rome on May 21. “Let me emphasise that there is strong cooperation going on between the president and the president of the European Council on future pandemic preparedness,” the commission’s deputy chief spokeswoman said. Last week EU leaders stopped short of giving Mrs von der Leyen their explicit backing for new European Commission rules allowing Brussels to target countries, like the UK, with higher vaccination rates and low vaccine exports to the EU with bans. Summit hardliners such as France’s Mr Macron, Mr Draghi and Mr Sanchez, who supported Mrs von der Leyen at Thursday’s European Council, signed the opinion piece, exacerbating the impression of an isolated commission president. Mr Michel spoke to Mr Johnson last week in a call that was credited as ensuring the UK ultimately supported the move for a new treaty. Before the summit, Mrs von der Leyen had warned that all options were on the table, including the triggering of Article 122, which would have empowered Brussels to impose bans, seize factories and waive intellectual property and patent rules. The commission today said that it could still consider the use of the wartime clause, if the new vaccine export rules did not speed up deliveries of jabs to the EU."

Unionist legal challenge over Northern Ireland Protocol set for High Court hearing
","
The case is now expected to be heard in mid-May as calls mount for the Government to scrap the protocol
","Harry Yorke, ","
29 March 2021 • 10:23pm
","A legal challenge by unionists against the Government over the Northern Ireland Protocol looks set to end up in the High Court after ministers dropped their opposition to the case being heard.  The judicial review, which is being pursued by the leaders of the three main unionist parties in Northern Ireland and Lord Trimble, one of the architects of the Good Friday Agreement, is now expected to be heard between May 13-18. The group, which includes Arlene Foster, Northern Ireland’s First Minister, are seeking to challenge the legality of the post-Brexit trading arrangements which were set up to reflect the province’s dual status of being in the UK internal market while continuing to apply many EU rules. The protocol has been blamed for fuelling trade disruption for businesses and consumers in Northern Ireland, with Boris Johnson now facing calls from prominent unionists for it to be overhauled.  The litigants argue that it also flies in the face of the Act of Union 1800 and the Good Friday Agreement, and have challenged the way in which Northern Ireland will be asked to provide consent for the protocol continuing or ending in 2024. John Larkin QC, the former attorney general of Northern Ireland, has been instructed to seek a judicial review. After the Government originally signalled it would contest the application for the case to be heard, Ben Habib, the former Brexit MEP who is coordinating the action, told The Daily Telegraph that ministers had now conceded the application.  It means a judge is now likely to grant permission for the case to be heard at the High Court in Belfast.  Commenting on Monday, Mr Habib said: “I am delighted the government has conceded that leave should be granted without a preliminary hearing. It’s doing so is an acknowledgement of the integrity of the grounds of our case.  “I know I speak for all of us, the complainants and our supporters, when I say we are looking forward to having our day in court.” Jim Allister QC, the leader of the unionist party Traditional Unionist Voice, added: “While it is welcome that HMG reversed its initial response and is not now opposing our leave application in the Judicial Review, it should now face up to the main issue.  “Is this Government, which built its Brexit policy on ‘taking back control’, going to make a mockery of its own mantra by defending in court a Protocol which hands control of Northern Ireland to the EU? “Is Boris Johnston’s government going to be the one that defends the Protocol’s flagrant breach of the Acts of Union and wholly disrespects the ‘consent principle’ on which it claims its Northern Ireland policy is based?  “It’s time for HMG to face reality and give up defending the indefensible and getting on the side of defending the integrity of the United Kingdom.” Mrs Foster said: “The Protocol is damaging Northern Ireland and needs scrapped. The Government should trigger Article 16 and restore the unfettered flow of goods from Great Britain to Northern Ireland.  “The granting of leave is another step towards this matter being tested in court. We want it dealt with as quickly as possible as more and more harm is inflicted every day the Protocol remains.”"

Jennifer Arcuri pursuing 'vendetta', say friends of Boris Johnson after latest affair claims
","
The Telegraph understands that the London Assembly committee will write to the Prime Minister asking why he did not declare his relationship

","Jennifer Arcuri is pursuing a “vendetta” against Boris Johnson, friends of the Prime Minister alleged on Monday night, as Downing Street insisted he had done nothing wrong. Mr Johnson’s   has resurfaced after she gave a series of embarrassing interviews to a tabloid newspaper, including revealing details of text messages and even releasing a ‘selfie’ photograph taken in his kitchen. Ms Arcuri, 36, claimed she had sex with Mr Johnson, then London’s mayor, on the sofa of the family home he shared with his now   in March 2016. Ms Arcuri also claims she sent him a topless photograph, which prompted Mr Johnson to reply in a text message that it was “enough to make a bishop kick through a stained-glass window”. The affair, which began in 2012 and ended in 2016, is currently subject to an investigation by the Greater London Assembly’s oversight committee over Mr Johnson’s failure to declare the relationship. Ms Arcuri, an American entrepreneur living in London at the time, was granted access to trade mission events and received funding from London & Partners, a company funded in part by the London mayor’s office to promote the city. However, on Monday night friends of Mr Johnson questioned Ms Arcuri’s motives in telling her story to the Sunday Mirror and Daily Mirror four years after their affair ended. It is understood she has received a sizeable sum for an old-fashioned “kiss and tell”. An ally of the Prime Minister said: “There is no doubt in my mind that Boris is guilty of a monumental lapse in taste. At what point is the hawking of a story that is three years old cease to be news and start to look like a vendetta.” Another friend suggested the relationship was only sporadic during those four years because Mr Johnson was “too busy” to have a sustained affair while still married and working as London’s mayor.  The friend questioned Ms Arcuri’s motive in taking the ‘selfie’ in the kitchen and then keeping it, along with text messages, for years afterwards. The friend said: “Is it really credible that Boris was rushing off for an afternoon bonk with this woman for four years? It seems incredible. I don’t think it could be on the scale she is claiming. “His aides knew where he was more or less the whole time. She [Arcuri] has obviously thought how she can maximise this for her own gain. You can’t blame her, but she has saved that photo and texts for years and then just waited.” The prospect of an inquiry could push Mr Johnson into the embarrassing position of having to defend his affair at a public hearing. The Telegraph understands that the London Assembly committee will write to him, probably after the mayoral elections in May, asking why he did not declare his relationship, confidentially at least, which would have allowed him to could keep the matter secret from his wife and family. If the committee is unhappy with his written responses, it could demand that he gives evidence in public. Sources said Ms Arcuri’s latest claims, made in the newspapers, were sufficient to trigger a new stage in the investigation. Len Duvall, the chair of the oversight committee, said in a statement: ""Our investigation will consider whether Boris Johnson conducted himself in a way that’s expected from anyone in that position. It’s important we get those answers, because Londoners deserve to have their politicians held accountable."" The Independent Office for Police Conduct (IOPC) said in 2020 that there would not be a criminal inquiry into whether “Mr Johnson used his position while Mayor of London to benefit and reward American businesswoman Jennifer Arcuri”. The IOPC said there was no evidence that Mr Johnson had “influenced the payment of any sponsorship monies to Ms Arcuri” or that he had “influenced or played an active part in securing her participation in trade missions”. But the IOPC said that under the broader  , “it would have been wise for Mr Johnson to have declared this as a conflict of interest, and a failure to do so could have constituted a breach of these broader principles”. Asked whether the Prime Minister would assist the GLA inquiry, his press secretary Allegra Stratton said: “He will engage, but this was already being looked at in detail by no less an authority than the Independent Office for Police Conduct. ""It found that these claims were untrue and unfounded. This was looked at in depth and it was found there was no case to answer. “The Prime Minister follows the Nolan Principles in conducting himself in public life.” Ms Stratton refused to say if he would give evidence in person if requested. She added: ""The work has been done, public time and money and effort has been spent looking into whether there has been any wrongdoing, and it was found that the Prime Minister, the then-London mayor, has no case to answer.""   Another friend of Mr Johnson’s added: “Given all the stuff that was written before at a moment of heightened political interest ... you would have thought they would have been able to make it stick before. Does the general public really give a toss? It’s not as though he’s ever tried to be whiter than white."""

Nicola Sturgeon: I will refuse to deal with Alex Salmond unless he apologises to accusers
","
She argued that he is only standing to become an MSP as he ""loves the limelight and can't bear not to be on stage"".

","Nicola Sturgeon has said she will refuse to have any dealings with Alex Salmond after the Holyrood election unless he apologises to the women who accused him of harassment. The First Minister said she would not work with her former mentor to deliver independence as he has not shown ""any sort of sign of acknowledging how people feel about how he behaved while he was First Minister."" She also delivered a  with his new Alba Party, arguing that he is only standing to become an MSP as he ""loves the limelight and can't bear not to be on stage"". Mr Salmond has said he wants to manipulate Holyrood's complicated electoral system to deliver a ""super-majority"" for independence, with nationalists voting SNP in their constituencies and for his party on the regional list. But Ms Sturgeon warned: ""At the end of the day we've got to win independence fair and square. We can't game or cheat our way to that."" Her intervention came as Neil Hanvey, an MP who switched sides over the weekend from the SNP to the Alba Party, admitted that a Holyrood ""super-majority"" for independence would not reflect the wishes of the electorate. Mr Hanvey, the Kirkcaldy and Cowdenbeath MP, insisted  Mr Salmond's aim of having a Holyrood chamber with 70 per cent of MSPs supporting independence would not be an abuse of the electoral system. Around half of Scots back separation. Mr Salmond was cleared of all 13 sex assault charges last year, but did admit inappropriate conduct. This included a drunken ""sleepy cuddle"" with a woman. During the recent Holyrood inquiry into the Scottish Government's unlawful investigation into allegations against him, he alleged that Ms Sturgeon's husband was part of a plot at the top of the SNP to have him imprisoned. The inquiry also heard corroborated evidence that a Scottish Government official passed the name of a woman who complained to Mr Salmond's former chief of staff.  The women also complained   following Mr Salmond's legal victories. He said at the weekend that while he would not ""forgive"" Ms Sturgeon, they  in an independence campaign. ""With the future of our country at stake, you have to put the past behind you, and campaign for the future,"" he said. But Ms Sturgeon told the Daily Record: ""If Alex had walked out of the courtroom and shown any sense of acknowledgement of what had been conceded in the courtroom, and the aspects of what he told me, maybe there is a foundation."" Arguing this was a necessary ""first step"" to repairing their relationship, she said: ""He hasn't done that and, therefore, I'm not sure what the basis would be for me to sit down with him and have that discussion."" She said Mr Salmond ""wants to move on because it suits him now to say that he wants to move on"" but some people will find that difficult to do while he displays ""no sense of reflection or contrition."" The SNP won 59 out of 73 constituencies in the 2016 election but only four on the regional list, which assigns seats to parties using a complicated form of proportional representation that deducts constituency wins. Mr Salmond has argued his plan for independence supporters to back his party on the list could dramatically increase the number of pro-separation MSPs elected but Ms Sturgeon warned the plan could ""hinder"" her efforts to get a majority. She said that he was ""effectively gambling with the outcome of the election and it could quite easily backfire and undermine the ability to get that majority."" But Mr Hanvey told BBC Radio Scotland: ""“I don’t think there’s any gaming going on there. This is the electoral system that exists. The Alba Party is a distinct and separate party to the SNP. ""It’s entirely proper and within the rules for us to develop a distinct platform to argue for the case of independence and that’s what we’re doing. That’s called democracy.” Alistair Carmichael MP, the Scottish Liberal Democrat campaign chair, said: ""The First Minister may bemoan the Salmond circus now but she spent decades telling everyone that he should be the one to lead an independent Scotland. ""It has been obvious for a long time what kind of man Alex Salmond is. The ongoing nationalist psychodrama puts recovery last and draws oxygen away from the most important issues facing our country."" Mr Salmond was approached for comment."

Scotland Yard cleared over handling of Sarah Everard vigil
","
Report concludes force acted appropriately when it broke up gathering at Clapham Common earlier this month
","Martin Evans, ","
30 March 2021 • 12:28pm
","The Metropolitan Police has been cleared over its   on Clapham Common. A report by Her Majesty's Inspectorate of Constabulary, Fire and Rescue Services (HMICFRS), concluded that the force had acted appropriately when it broke up the gathering earlier this month. Scotland Yard came in for intense criticism over its handling of the vigil, with some even calling for  , the Met Commissioner, to resign. But Matt Parr, the inspector, who carried out the review, at the behest of Priti Patel, the Home Secretary, said much of the criticism had been unwarranted and showed a lack of respect to the police. He said: “After reviewing a huge body of evidence – rather than a snapshot on social media – we found that there are some things the Met could have done better, but we saw nothing to suggest police officers acted in anything but a measured and proportionate way in challenging circumstances. He added: ""Condemnation of the Met’s actions within mere hours of the vigil – including from people in positions of responsibility – was unwarranted, showed a lack of respect for public servants."" The vigil, which was held to remember Miss Everard, the 33-year-old marketing executive who was abducted and killed as she walked home in south London earlier this month, had been ruled illegal by Scotland Yard because of Covid regulations. But the HMICFRS found that an event on Clapham Common could have taken place because the right to protest remains even during the pandemic. The inspectorate concluded that, in this case, the Met’s decision to prioritise consistency with their approach to policing other mass gatherings during the Covid-19 lockdown was right. The report stated that while the vast majority of those who attended the vigil behaved in a dignified and respectful way, ""peaceful and reasonable intent of the many was overshadowed by the malign actions of a few"".  The report said: ""We viewed hours of body-worn video footage and heard officers patiently pleading with people to go home. It was clear that officers were explaining and encouraging people to leave. When the decision to ‘move to enforcement’ was made, our review found nothing to suggest that officers acted inappropriately or in a heavy-handed manner.  ""In fact, we found evidence of patience and professionalism during engagement prior to, during and after arrest.""  The report also revealed that the police have received 463 messages of praise and 181 messages of criticism. And the report also stated that while the event had been intended as a vigil for Miss Everard ""it was clearly attended by those with other causes in mind"". Commenting on the report, Sir Tom Winsor, Her Majesty’s Chief Inspector of Constabulary said: “Our civilian police model is precious.  Officers are our fellow citizens, invested by the community to keep the community safe.  ""They rely upon and are entitled to receive public support when they act lawfully, sensitively and proportionately; in this case, in the face of severe provocation and in very difficult circumstances, they did just that.” Scotland Yard insisted that it had facilitated the event up until the point when people began to make political speeches, at which stage officers moved in to break up what had become an illegal gathering under Covid regulataions. Four people were arrested but footage of the police's actions went viral, leading to widespread condemnation. Sadiq Khan, the Mayor of London, expressed concern over the Met's conduct and after holding an emergency meeting with Dame Cressida said he was not satisfied with the force's explanation. The report added: ""Police officers are ordinary men and women doing their jobs. They are citizens in uniform, part of the community. Just as much as their fellow citizens, they are entitled to be treated with decency. They are expected to act with restraint when faced with severe provocation."" The Metropolitan Police Federation demanded an apology from politicians who had criticised them, and damaged their reputation. Ken Marsh, Chairman of the Metropolitan Police Federation, said: “The outcome of this report comes as no surprise. We said on the very evening that politicians of all parties should make themselves aware of all the facts before rushing to judgment and making statements. “But these armchair critics on their Saturday night sofas did not. The knee-jerk commentary from politicians of all parties – who, as the report states, were reacting to a snapshot on social media rather than the facts – has made the already difficult job of our colleagues in London incredibly harder. And more dangerous. And for that these people should be ashamed. “As the independent report states: “Condemnation of the Met’s actions within mere hours of the vigil – including from people in positions of responsibility – was unwarranted, showed a lack of respect for public servants facing a complex situation, and undermined public confidence in policing based on very limited evidence.” “We could not have said it better ourselves. This was outrageous behaviour from those who should know better and we trust as elected officials and we now call on these politicians to make themselves accountable and to apologise to our hard-working colleagues for the damage they have done.” In a statement, Sadiq Khan, said while he accepted the report's findings he was still concerned about the trust and confidence women had in policing in London. “I completely understand why women, girls and allies wanted to hold a vigil to remember Sarah at Clapham Common and show solidarity with all women who have been subjected to violence at the hands of men.   “While I do not have operational control over the police, I called for the Government and MPS to find a way to allow the vigil to happen legally and safely in advance of Saturday 13 March, and was provided with assurances that the MPS would police it sensitively.  “It is my job to stand up on behalf of Londoners and ensure that there is effective scrutiny of the Metropolitan Police - particularly in the light of such widespread public dismay. “I accept the HMICFRS report, but it is clear that trust and confidence of women and girls in the police and criminal justice system is far from adequate. The events of the weekend of 13/14 March have done further damage to this and show that much more needs to be done.” A Home Office spokesman said: “The Home Secretary received the Inspectorate’s report this morning and is studying its findings closely. “She is grateful to Sir Thomas Winsor, HMI Matt Parr and their team for conducting this review at speed. “She recognises that the police have done a difficult job throughout the pandemic and is grateful for their tireless work.” Responding to the report the Met's Assistant Commissioner, Louisa Rolfe, said the force was determined to do everything it could to tackle violence against women and girls. She went on: “This report makes clear the difficult circumstances officers faced as a peaceful vigil became a hostile rally. We must always be consistent in our policing of public events. “I am extremely proud of the restraint, compassion and professionalism officers showed during a fast-moving and challenging situation. “They spent considerable time engaging, explaining and encouraging before considering any enforcement action. “Officers acted thoughtfully, sensibly and proportionately with the best interests of Londoners at heart given we remain in a public health crisis. “We welcome the considered scrutiny of this event which highlights how a snapshot may not represent the full context of the challenges police face.”"
